            "Bangladesh is deprived of around $7.8 billion (Tk 750 billion) in remittance a year due to the money laundering by at least 5,000 agents of Mobile Financial Service (MFS) in the country. ",
            "Criminal Investigation Department (CID) revealed this information at a press conference after arresting 16 members of that hundi gang.",

        "date": "30 Aug 2022",
        "content": [
            "Trial has begun in none of the four cases filed against former Juba League leader Ismail Hossain Chowdhury alias Samrat who was arrested on allegation of involvement in casino business. He was arrested while going into a hiding during a ‘purging operation’ in Awami League three years ago. Police, Rapid Action Battalion and Anti-Corruption Commission filed cases against him under narcotics control act, arms act as well as for money laundering and amassing wealth beyond known income sources.",
            "According to a Prothom Alo report, this expelled leader of Juba League brought out a big showdown on streets on 26 August after walking out of jail on bail in four cases. He went to Dhammondi 32, taking along several thousands of leaders and activists by motorcycles, cars and pickup vans. His supports were seen chanting slogans. The entourage created a traffic gridlock on roads in Russell Square and adjacent areas on the weekend. Such showdown by an accused in severe crimes usually raised various questions and fear among people.",
            "Law enforcement agencies had launched a large-scale drive against illegal casino operation from September to December of 2019. The series of drives unearthed who were earning billions of taka through casino business using political clout and how they were laundering a big portion of this money as well.",
            "The anti-casino operation also revealed that a faction of Awami League’s associate bodies Juba League and Swechasebak League got involved in gambling, casino, money laundering, arms scandal, extortion and torture.",
            "According to police and court sources, trial proceedings of the persons arrested during the drives against casino operation are going very slowly. Other than Samrat, 13 people including Arman, Khaled Mahmud Bhuiyan, GK Shamim and Selim Pradhan were arrested during the drives. Fifty-seven cases were filed against them, with charge sheet being filed in 52 of these cases, but trial proceedings are yet to begin as charge framing hasn’t been completed in most of the cases and verdict was delivered in just one case.",
            "Charge sheet was filed with the court in three cases against Samrat though charges were framed in neither of these cases. Besides, court could not accept charge sheet in money laundering case as investigation is yet to be concluded. Investigating officials concerned said Samrat allegedly laundered Tk 1.98 billion to Singapore and Malaysia, and spent a big portion of these money at casinos in Singapore. According to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), letters have been sent to Singapore and Malaysia seeking information on the money laundered by Samrat, but no reply is yet to be received.",
            "Samrat had been undergoing treatment at the prison cell of Dhaka Medical College Hospital for a long time with the excuse of being severely ill. The question is how a seriously ill person can stage a showdown with followers, right after being freed on bail. Influential people, either convicted or undergoing trial, have been noticed staying in hospital’s prison cell instead of lockup, in the name of treatment even before. Many information about their comfy life came to light as well.",
            "ACC appealed at the High Court seeking revocation of Samrat’s bail. According to law, before being convicted at the court there is the right to avail bail in any bailable lawsuit. None of the allegations found against most of the people including Samrat, arrested during the casino raid, are less severe. Others including Samrat kept committing such crimes time and again using their political power. The fact that the trial of these sensational cases has not started yet after a long time is simultaneously disappointing as well as concerning. Procrastination in trial is an obstacle to justice. Justice free from political influence is desired by all."

Is it like a cat would eat fish, but would not wet her feet? Whatever it is, the name of the person (the officer who provided the papers to submit at court) must not come out. Why so fearful? He who supplied the information could have given a signature at least. You neither have written the name, nor gave any signature. This is extremely careless behaviour. Would anyone accept this?

After all, the people have learnt that fuel imports have been slashed due to paucity of forex reserves. This has led to load shedding. Then again, the price of fuel oil has been hiked by a record amount and the people are bearing the brunt.",
            "The people, concerned with forex reserves, are naturally more curious now than ever before, about the country’s money being siphoned off overseas. They now know that around USD 12 billion has been illicitly sent out of Bangladesh over the past 14 years. They observe that while there is a shortfall of foreign exchange reserves in the country, the volume of Bangladeshi deposits in the Swiss banks has increased this year (2022) by 55 per cent, compared to the previous year. These facts and figures are enough to rile the people.",
            "In these circumstances, Switzerland’s ambassador to Bangladesh, Nathalie Chuard, said in no uncertain terms, there are allegations that most of the money deposited by Bangladeshis in the various Swiss banks has been earned through illicit means. The important bit of information that she revealed was that till now the Bangladesh government has not approached the Swiss banks or the concerned authorities through any official process, for information in this regard. The reaction to the Swiss ambassador’s words was as expected. The foreign minister said that the Swiss ambassador had not told the truth. Meanwhile, the High Court has asked the state and the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) whether the government had actually asked the Swiss authorities for information regarding the funds of the Bangladeshis. On Sunday the state and ACC responded. They told the court that the Swiss ambassador’s statement had not been correct. Information on 67 persons had been sought through the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU). Information on one person among them has been availed.",
            "Has this response by the state and ACC to the court query cleared the confusion? Does that mean that the Swiss ambassador’s statement was untrue? Let’s turn to what the court had to say to the state and ACC’s lawyers after their statement. The court said, “The ambassador’s statement had created confusion. Your (the state and ACC) statement will clear the confusion. You wanted information about the fund depositors, they are not providing it. Or they put forward certain conditions in providing the information. You have said you have asked for the information and have taken steps. You have made this clear. The people will assess whether you are telling the truth or not.”",
            "Since the High Court has left the matter of assessing the “truth” upon us, the people, we have the right to speak about this then. Our confusion has not been cleared by the statements of the state and ACC. In fact, more questions have arisen. The reply given by the state and ACC about asking for information on 67 persons, is nothing new. Many of us will recall a seminar held in June on '20 years of BFIU in the prevention of money laundering and terrorism funding in Bangladesh’. The key note paper had been presented by the BFIU additional director Md Kamal Hossain. He had said, BFIU has received information at various times from the Swiss National Bank about money laundering by 67 individuals and companies of Bangladesh.",
            "The inquiry about the 67 persons or organisations is nothing new, but what we learnt new from the state and ACC sources, is that information on only one person has been availed. This is contradictory to the statement made by the BFIU additional director. Does that mean information concerning the rest was not provided, or that the Swiss authorities do not have any information about them worth giving? The matter is unclear in the statements of the state and ACC lawyers.",
            "The question that has naturally arisen in our minds, for all practical purposes, is who are these 67 entities? In our experience, ACC had investigated into some instances of corruption and has taken action against some corrupt persons, but there are no instances of them taking any measures against anyone in the ruling party or those of their camp. That is why further questions pop up in our mind. On what basis were the details of these 67 persons sought? Since credibility is invariably in question, it is difficult to believe that this has been done without any political bias and consideration. Has the government really asked at all about the actual suspects? Are the names of any ruling party persons or their close associates on the list of persons about whom the queries were made? And also, did Bangladesh follow the procedures referred to by the Swiss ambassador about applying for information on the deposits and transactions of Bangladeshi nationals with the Swiss banks?",
            "It is no crime to keep funds in a Swiss bank or any other foreign bank. The important matter is whether the funds are legitimate and if these were sent through legitimate channels. Rather than approaching the Swiss authorities about information on a select few, why does the Bangladesh government not ask for information on the transactions of all Bangladeshi nationals? Why just of 67?",
            "Transparency International Bangladesh’s executive director, Iftekharuzzaman, wrote in an article published in Prothom Alo on Sunday, that if Bangladesh joins in the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), it will automatically receive information on all transactions at home and abroad in the banking and financial sector. It will receive information on the transactions with all foreign banks, not just Swiss banks. This is an effective method to prevent tax evasion and capital flight. There are 120 countries in the world who have signed up in this process, including India and Pakistan from South Asia.",
            "The question is, why is Bangladesh not joining up with CRS? That is why the doubts are not being cleared as to whether Bangladesh really wants to know who have kept funds in the Swiss and other overseas banks and if this is legitimate at all.",

            "In the parliament on 28 June in 2014, the government firmly assured the countrymen of sending a request letter to the Swiss government seeking the list of depositors. At the same time, steps will be taken to bring back the laundered money from the Swiss banks. This promise has been renewed by the government every year since then.",
            "Different statements started coming to the fore in 2016. Former finance minister late Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on 11 July issued a statement in the parliament under the section-300, saying that the reports of money laundering in Swiss banks are actually exaggerations. Later, current finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal said in the parliament, targeting the opposition members, that “I do not have the list of people who laundered money. If you know the names, give these to us.”",

            "So it seems that the government has actually backtracked gradually on the issue of money launderers, including those who deposited money in Swiss banks. Why did the government’s retreat trigger so many discussions?",
            "A specific answer was found on Wednesday when the Swiss ambassador in Dhaka, Nathalie Chuard, talked about the issue. The ambassador said there are allegations that most of the money deposited by Bangladeshi nationals in various banks in Switzerland is amassed illegally. But the Bangladesh government is yet to seek any specific information from the Swiss banks or relevant authorities.",
            "She came up with the statement at a discussion – DCAB Talk – organized by the Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB) at the National Press Club.",
            "According to the annual report of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) released in June, 2022, the amount of money deposited by Bangladeshis in various banks in Switzerland stood at Tk 82.76 billion at the end of 2021, up by 55 per cent or Tk 9.28 billion from Tk 53.48 billion deposited in 2020.",
            "Regarding the issue, Nathalie Chuard said, “We have informed the government what needs to be done to avail information, but we are yet to receive any request for any specific information. We are committed to maintaining international standards. Such information sharing is possible based on the consent of both sides and it needs to be done. We are working with Bangladesh on this.”",
            "She also said the Swiss National Bank provides the information on annual deposits made by Bangladeshi nationals and it is quite impossible for them to say whether the money was earned illegally or not.",
            "So, it is evident from the statement of Nathalie Chuard that Bangladesh has never made arrangements to get any information from the Swiss bank, let alone bring the money back.",
            "We know that some 121 countries are receiving information of depositors from the Swiss banks. In fact, there is an international framework for receiving information from the Swiss banking system, called the Automatic Exchange of Information (AOI), which has been in place since 2017.",
            "Under this framework, if someone deposits money in a Swiss bank by evading taxes in their home country, the Swiss banks are obliged to provide information on their deposits. However, Bangladesh is not on the list of 121 countries.",
            "So the question is - does the government really want to know the names or information of the money launderers? The only government action made so far on money laundering is a gazette notification issued on 8 August.",
            "The National Board of Revenue (NBR) said in the notification that the laundered money can now be brought home through banking channels with a tax of 7 per cent.",
            "In other words, there is no punishment for money laundering; no action against the launderers; rather the government is doing nothing except for the policy of providing benefits to the launderers. All that remains is speech, nothing else."

            "When all the countries of the world have been trying hard to come out of the grip of high inflation rate, the Bangladesh government at that very moment invited inflation by hiking the fuel oil price at a record margin of up to 51 per cent.",
            "This record price hike will stoke the inflation rate more and bring sufferings for the low income people.",
            "Inflation is being considered as the biggest problem for the global economy right now. ",
            "International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the current rate of inflation in different countries is the biggest threat for macro economy. Inflation rate in the US and the UK has reached the highest point in the last 40 years.",
            "The situation is so bad that the experts have been even advising to accept recession to get over the pressure of high inflation rate.",
            "All the countries have been trying to fight inflation by reducing the supply of money. As a result, both the investment and demand have been decreasing. That’s why the symptoms of recession have already appeared in the global economy. ",
            "Despite all the steps, if the inflation rate does not decrease and economy contracts more, there will be ‘stagflation’. This means high inflation rate and high unemployment rate. The World Bank thinks many countries have been going towards that situation.",
            "Bangladesh has also been facing the heat of this global economic turmoil. Import cost has already soared due to hike of prices of all types of products including fuel and food stuff. The remittance earning has decreased. Deficit in current income is USD 1869.70 crore (over 18.69 billion), which is the highest in the last 50 years. This means the dollar crisis has appeared as income of foreign currency has decreased. As a result, the value of taka is decreasing. All of these have been hitting the forex reserve hard. The inflation rate is rising because of all of these. In this context, the government has hiked the prices of fuel oil from 42 to 51 per cent.",
            "Before the onslaught of coronavirus, China devalued its currency by a large margin to retain its export capacity. China devalued Yuan by 33 per cent between 2015 and 2019. Because of that decision of China, competing countries were also forced to take the same path. That was termed as currency war. Bangladesh was the exception. Though the economy was at a better condition, Bangladesh Bank retained the value of taka despite calls from the exporters. The central bank, however, was forced to devalue the taka but at a rather tough time. In the last seven months, taka has been devalued against each US Dollar by Tk 8.90. Still the crisis persists. The current crisis would not have been hit with such a magnitude if the money was devalued little by little, the economists said.",
            "The oil price dipped to the lowest point in history in 2014. The price was less than USD 50 per barrel. Until 2020, the price was low. The oil price started rising when the economies started rebuilding process following the Covid-19 infection. But the real crisis started after the break out of Russia and Ukraine war on 24 February. Almost all the countries felt the shockwave when the prices of fuel oil, metallic goods, food stuff and fertiliser started rising. At a stage, oil price rose to USD 120 per barrel. Then the government said the price of oil will not be increased for now.",
            "Finally, the government hiked the oil price at such a time when price of almost all types of goods including oil is decreasing fearing recession globally. The oil price decreased to lowest point on Friday since February, almost USD 95 per barrel. ",
            "In a report ‘Global Commodity Insights’ Standard and Poor's said for now the price explosion in fuel, agricultural and metallic goods has ended. The price will go on dipping because of the symptoms of recession. Just at that time, this price hike of fuel oil up to 51 per cent has astonished all and the general people have become panicked. Though some people have acknowledged the rationale of increasing the oil price taking the global situation into consideration, none has been saying the rate of hike as tolerable. The entrepreneurs have have expressed their concerns. The question is why the government had to take this path?",
            "The government is actually cash-stripped. On the one hand, the income of foreign currency has decreased, and on the other, the income in local currency has not increased too. The income tax-GDP ratio in Bangladesh is among the lowest in the world. That means, though GDP has increased, the income of the government has not increased. Though people’s per capita income has been rising, the income tax is not rising. As a result, the earning is almost being finished in paying salaries and allowances, interest of loans, subsidy and grants. Some of the remaining money is being used in development projects. Amid this, the government falls in extremely critical situation whenever expenses in any one sector shoot up suddenly. That has happened now.",
            "In the budget of 2021-22 financial year, the allocation in subsidy was Tk 420 billion (42,000 crore). But, the expenses rose to Tk 660 billion (66,000 crore) as cost of import in power, fuel and other sectors increased. The subsidy allocation in the current 2022-23FY budget is almost Tk 830 billion (83,000 crore). The financial year has started just now but the government does not want to bear the subsidy cost at this moment. As a result, the people who have been passing days in high inflation rate will have to bear the whole burden of loss in fuel oil. The government is not even relaxing the 32 per cent of duty the National Board of Revenue (NBR) gets from oil import as the income from duty is low. The Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), however, made a huge profit of Tk 430 billion (43,000 crore) between 2014 and 2020 by buying oil at low price and selling that to the people at high price.",
            "Regarding this, distinguished fellow at Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Debapriya Bhattacharya told Prothom Alo that hiking the fuel oil price or taking such a step is symptom, not the disease. The disease is the government has increased growth but could not increase the collection of revenue. The government is actually in crisis of cash now. It can be said that a poor government of a country with high growth rate that does not have money to spend. The main reason for this is inefficiency in revenue collection. So, either the high income that has been talked about was illusory or could not show efficiency in tax management. Because, it could not collect income tax from the persons, the coterie and organisations that made huge profit due to the government’s patronisation, rather, they have been given opportunities to whiten their black money or the money they laundered.",
            "Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the organisation of all the central banks of the world, said availing money has become easier and cheaper for the last few years. Almost all the countries decreased interest rate. Stimulus packages provided during the time of Covid was also cheaper. All are trying to curb that supply of money to decrease the pressure of inflation rate. That’s why so far 75 central banks have increased interest rate. That means almost all are using monetary policy to curb the inflation rate.",
            "Only Bangladesh is the exception. New governor of Bangladesh Bank, Abdur Rouf Talukder said he will not bring changes in interest rate. That means, the interest rate that was made 9 per cent under pressure from the businesspeople will remain so. Though it has been seen that a large portion of the loan, taken at a low interest rate, has become defaulted. As a result, the government has been providing new benefits.",
            "Interest rate is globally recognised as main weapon to curb inflation rate. Besides, some duty policies are also taken. For example, increase the tax rate, controlling import, decreasing the government’s budget. The government is adopting these measures. The experts, however, have questions on how far this would be effective. Because, almost everyone apprehends inflation rate would increase because of the margin at which the fuel price has been hiked. As a result of this, though the government’s expenses will decrease a bit, people’s expenses will soar. Earlier in 2012-13FY, the inflation rate increased up to 12 per cent following hiking the price of fuel oil.",
            "In the preceding years, Bangladesh focused on achieving high growth rate. But it did not take sufficient steps to increase the income tax-GDP ratio. The financial sector is under the grip of influential people, no reform was carried out in the sector. Money laundering has not decreased. Amount of foreign investment is negligible. Export income is mostly dependent on one type of product. The central bank could not come up with an effective monetary policy to control the inflation rate. Though power generation has increased, primary fuel required for the sector is almost wholly dependent on import. The country could not increase its efficiency in energy sector. The fallout of these structural problems was not felt much during the better days. But everything has become sources of danger during this time of crisis. Experts think the governments actually have not carried carried out any reform almost in the last 18 years. The economy has been bearing the brunt of all these. In this context, the crisis will not be over unless large structural reforms are made.",

            "Collecting primary information and intelligence reports and identifying assets have been described as strategies to recover the laundered money. The next course of action will be confiscation of assets, joint investigation by both countries and initiative to reclaim the laundered money.",
            "However, these are lengthy processes and this is why an initiative can be taken to bring the money back by imposing high tax, it added."

            "In the context of the global economic instability caused by the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, the proposed budget for 2022-23 fiscal has offered an opportunity to bring back the laundered money. Various organisations and economists, including Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), the apex body of traders, have strongly criticised this decision. Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal has urged people not to oppose the decision arguing that this money has people’s share. But it is clear from the statement of planning minister MA Mannan that the decision is unrealistic.",
            "According to Prothom Alo, in a webinar jointly organised by the Economic Reporters Forum, Rapid and Asia Foundation on the proposed budget on Sunday, the planning minister said, \"Once money is smuggled out of the country, it is almost impossible to get it back.\"",
            "He said, “We have neither the legal process nor the power to bring back the money deposited by the Bangladeshis in the Swiss bank.” Why did the government take such an impossible decision then? While answering this question, the minister has left the matter to the launderers’ discretion by taking refuge in the proverb “The devil would not listen to the scripture”. ",
            "This clearly means that the government itself knows that it is impossible to bring the smuggled money back to the country. Instead, the planning minister advised to pay attention to preventing the outflow of the money from the country.",
            "Bangladesh Bank has no reliable information of how millions flows out of Bangladesh every year. According to Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington-based research institute in the United States, about Tk 640 billion is smuggled from Bangladesh every year in the name of business. According to the report of the Swiss National Bank, in the last two years (2021) the highest amount of money has been deposited in various banks in Switzerland in the name of Bangladeshi individuals and organisations. ",
            "Bangladesh Bank, though, said that the money that went to different countries including Swiss Banks was not siphoned from Bangladesh. However, in a seminar on 18 June, the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) said that it had received information from various Swiss National Banks about the money laundering of 67 individuals and organisations in Bangladesh. The agency, set up to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, also believes that recovering laundered money is a complex process.",
            "In Bangladesh, the state has been providing special benefits to the owners of black money since 1976. There has been little response in decades. Analysts believe that the country has entered a new height of whitewashing black money with the opportunity to bring back the money laundered by paying only 7 per cent tax in this year's proposed budget. Many feel through this opportunity the launderers are being rewarded legitimacy. Some have strongly criticised this opportunity as unconstitutional and unlawful.",
            "When there is so much questioning, criticism and doubt within the government about the benefits of recovering laundered money, what is the rationale of the opportunity? The main crisis is that the revenue in the budget cannot be increased because of the effort to protect the interests of various groups. That is the reason behind taking such measures. To increase the revenue and expenditure deficit in the budget, practical steps have to be taken to increase the revenue. The authority must come out of the impossible hope of getting the laundered money back. Instead, they must focus on stopping the capital flight."

            "At the end of 2021, the total amount of money deposited in the Swiss Banks stood at 871.1 million Swiss francs (87 crore 11 lakh Swiss francs). Given the exchange rate of Tk 95 per Swiss franc, this amount stands at around Tk 82.76 billion (Tk 8,276 crore) in local currency.",
            "In 2020 the total deposits of Bangladeshis in those banks had been 562.9 million Swiss francs (56 crore 29 lakh Swiss francs) or Tk 53.48 billion (Tk 5,348 crore). That means the amount of money kept by Bangladeshis in the Swiss banks has gone up by Tk 29.28 billion (Tk 2928 crore), that is, 55 per cent. This was revealed in the annual report of Switzerland's central bank Swiss National Bank (SNB).",
            "This news of the 55 per cent jump in Bangladeshi deposits in Swiss banks comes at a time when the government has taken initiative to bring back the laundered money for a trifling tax payment. In the 2022-23 financial year's proposed budget announced on 9 June, finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal gave scope for laundered money to be brought back to the country at a nominal tax of 7 per cent. This has given rise to a volley of criticism within the country.",
            "Businesspersons, economists and representatives of the civil society -- everyone has criticised this move by the government. However, at the pre-budget press briefing on 10 June, finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal said that, \"Money has been siphoned out of Bangladesh to many different countries. That is why steps have been taken to bring this money back.\" The finance minister also asked that no move be made to prevent this money to be brought back into the country. At the same press briefing, the Bangladesh Bank governor Fazle Kabir claimed, \"The money that has gone to various countries, including to Swiss banks, has not gone from Bangladesh.\"",
            "In the meantime, the Swiss National Bank's report says that in a matter of one year, Bangladeshis' money in different Swiss banks has gone up by nearly Tk 30 billion (Tk 3000 crore). This is a record high for Bangladeshi funds deposited in Swiss banks over the past two decades. In 2000, the amount of money deposited by Bangladeshis in Swiss banks stood at only 50.9 billion Swiss francs (5 crore 19 lakh Swiss francs) of Tk 4.93 billion (Tk 493 crore) in local currency.",
            "In 2021 this sum increased to 871.1 million (87 crore 11 lakh Swiss francs) or Tk 82.76 billion (Tk 8,276 crore). In 2014 the amount of money of Bangladeshis in Swiss banks for the first time exceeded 500 million Swiss francs (50 crore Swiss francs). In the seven years since then, the amount of deposits there increased in four years. In 2019 and 2020 consecutively, Bangladeshis' deposits in Swiss banks had fallen. But over the last one year this increased by 55 per cent.",
            "Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit of BFIU is the institution responsible to collect information on money being siphoned out of Bangladesh overseas. The head of this unit at present is Dr Masud Biswas. He did not receive a call made to him over mobile phone to get his comment on the issue. The BFIU head in 2021 had been Abu Hena Mohd Razi Hasan. When asked about the matter last night, he told Prothom Alo, it cannot be said for sure that the money mentioned in the Swiss central bank's report had gone from Bangladesh. Bangladeshis live in many different countries and they can have money in those banks. So it would not be right to conclude that all of this is laundered money. However, BFIU and various agencies of the government are working to prevent money laundering.",
            "In the Swiss National Bank report, they money deposited by individuals and companies from various countries including Bangladesh, are described as 'liabilities' to be returned to the client when asked.",
            "Indian deposits in Swiss banks increased too in 2021. Towards the end of 2021, deposits by Indians in Swiss banks stood at nearly 3.83 billion Swiss francs (383 crore Swiss francs) or around Tk 363.75 billion (Tk 36,375 crore) in Bangladeshi currency. In 2020 the deposits of Indians in those banks stood at 2.55 billion Swiss francs (255 crore Swiss francs) or Tk 242.5 billion (Tk 24,250 crore) in Bangladeshi currency.",
            "According to experts, the deposits mentioned in the Swiss National Bank's reports are not all necessarily 'black money'. Bangladeshis also keep their money legally in the various banks there. Bangladeshis living in various countries around the world keep their money in various countries including Switzerland. So even though living abroad, when their deposit money as Bangladeshis, that is considered as Bangladeshis' money. However, money from various countries is also illegally transferred to Switzerland.",
            "Meanwhile, though the amount of Bangladeshis' deposits in Swiss banks has been increasing over the past two decades, the government has taken no visible initiative to collect details of the owners of this wealth or to bring the wealth back to the country. This time in the budget, though, a move has been made to bring back laundered money by offering tax discounts.",
            "When asked about this issue, Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) distinguished fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya told Prothom Alo, from past experience, facts and figures, we have seen that capital flight from the country increases just before the elections. Earlier, business capital was siphoned off in the guise of trade.",
            "He said, now financial capital is being siphoned off. The corrupt ring involved in this is now internationalised. They have also become powerful in government policymaking. That is why the budget proposal has been made to bring this money back to the country for an inconsequential payment of tax. Even our policies have been snatched by the clique of internationalised corruption."

            "There are certain calculations regarding the budget allocations, expenditure and source of funds. Outside of that, other important factors are the economic policies, strategies and guidelines in running the state. What guidelines does this budget offer?",
            "The budget is an account of the state's income and expenditure. This is supposed to be drawn up in keeping with the country's economic policies and strategy. If mid-term and long-term strategies are taken into consideration, then the basis for this is the eighth five-year plan and context. Implementation of the sixth and seventh five-year plans also has to be taken into consideration. We have to see how far the present budget is in keeping with reaching this target. Unfortunately, there is no semblance between our policy document and the budget. This happened in the case of the previous budgets and this time as well. This problem is simply increasing by the day. While there are certain positive aspects, the overall budget is not compatible with the policy declared by the government. The government is not keeping its own word.",
            "This time the budget had to be prepared amid fears of a global recession. Prior to the budget many of you had advised to place importance on keeping the price of commodities under control. Has that been reflected at all in the proposed budget?",
            "The budget acknowledges the problem but did not take the required measures. The question is, what can the government do to control prices in a free market? The government has to create such a link with the private sector so that no unlawful advantages can be taken. The private sector must be made to abide by the law and it is important to monitor them and ensure their accountability. The budget has no mention of how the government will do this. The competition commission, the consumer rights directorate or the commerce ministry are responsible for this, but the capacity of these institutions is weak. The budget says nothing about this, offers no guidelines.",
            "The government has certain tools to keep commodity prices in control. If any essential items are dependent on import, the government can temporarily or for a year or so lift all sorts of duty from those products. This budget has no such measure. It is essential to know the demand in order to keep the commodity market normal. Based on this, procurement is determined. But we have a lack of data in this regard. As a result, how much of a product is to be imported, how much concessions can be made, what will the outcome of this be -- nothing can be calculated accurately.",
            "Another important point of discussion was relieving pressure from the poor population. How far has the budget dealt with that?",
            "While the number of poor under assistance has been increased from 7 million to 10 million, there are still discrepancies in data. According to a survey run in 2016, the size of the poor population in the country is 20.5 per cent. The number of new poor has increased under the impact of corona. This is not being acknowledged. It is not only the poor, but the lower and middle class who are also under pressure. Their income has not increased. Quite to the contrary, it has decreased in many cases. They are having to cut costs in food and areas outside of food. The effect of this will become apparent in the coming days. The budget has identified the price of commodities as a major problem, but offers no solution.",
            "What are your observations about the allocations for health and education?",
            "Allocations in the education sector, in proportion to the GDP, has decreased from last time. The health sector is the same as before. This allocation has no consistency with the five-year plan. Allocations should be increased in these two sectors, but these are being decreased. No matter what they may say, the policymakers are not understanding the importance of this. If the head of a family cannot spend as must as needed on his children's health and education, these children will not be able to grow up competent, skilled and capable. Now if the government is our guardian and fails to spend in these two areas, then the future population of the country will not be educated and in good health. It is hard to hold on to economic development with such a population. The demographic dividend that is being talked about will last only for another 10 to 15 years. Unless we can invest as promised for this generation, then the aspirations we have for the future of Bangladesh will not be fulfilled.",
            "Alongside keeping the prevailing circumstances under control, it is also important to keep up exports, growth, graduate to a mid-income country and proceed with meeting the SDG. How balanced do you think this budget has been in this regard?",
            "The target of this budget seems very temporary. The immediate problems have been kept in mind, but less important has been given to achieving the targets. There are some areas that deserve praise. For instance, no delay was made in adjusting the dollar value with the market. This will have a positive impact on increasing imports and formal remittance. The budget talks about a 7.5 per cent growth. But it must be seen whether this growth is inclusive. Poverty is a big problem, there is the problem of unemployment, and disparity is increasing. These matters are discussed, but there is no guideline how to emerge from this.",
            "This budget is being termed as business-friendly. What do you say?",
            "I won't call this budget entirely business-friendly. Corporate taxes have been decreased and concessions have been made for certain industries. The formal sector pays corporate taxes. But 85 per cent of our business is in the informal sector and they play the biggest role in providing employment. This sector has been hit hard by Covid. They also lag behind in receiving stimulus. There is nothing for small and medium entrepreneurs in this budget. This budget can be termed as friendly to the big businesses.",
            "There has been a proposal to legalise laundered money. There is an ethical side to this. The question can arise as to how ethical this is. The other question is, do you think the money that has been siphoned out of the country will be brought back as a result of this facility?",
            "The people who have smuggled money out of the country are being rewarded by this decision. They have profited by siphoning off the money and will benefit again by bringing it back at low interest. This is not ethically acceptable. This will give a bad message. The question is whether this will be effective or not. How must money does the government expect will return? Does the government have any record of how much money has been laundered and how much may be brought back? If the government is aware of how the money is being sent out, then initiative must be taken to block this route. Some countries have taken steps to bring money back, but the results have not been positive. Why will the launderers weaken themselves ethically in front of the government? In any consideration, this decision should be cancelled.",
            "If you had the chance to make some amendments to this budget, where would you propose the amendments be made?",
            "The challenges which have been considered in the budget are relevant and important. The advice of many people from outside of the government has been taken. This deserves thanks. At the same time, the impact of inflation has fallen upon many outside of the recognised poor. The budget does not recognise the reality of this crisis that they are facing and that this is a major challenge. Some initiatives must be taken to recognise this and relieve the people of this pressure. Another thing that is necessary is for the government to make the budget more compatible to its own policies and strategies and this calls for placing due importance on health, education and social safety nets.",

Huge money of the country has been laundered. This scope is given in different countries.\"",
            "\"We are giving that scope. Why should we continue this scope if this does not yield any good results? We have given this opportunity in the budget this time with a view to getting a positive result.\"",

Despite this, it is also seen that officials are still using office vehicles. Nothing has been said in the budget in this regard to prevent waste of public money.",

            "Just recovering from the impact of the corona outbreak over the past two years, it was time for the people to rise up and stand on their own two feet, but a new crisis has emerged on the global economic scenario. After the pandemic, the new cause for concern is inflation. The finance minister, in the new budget, has acknowledged the pressure of inflation, has even spoken about lessening this pressure. But he has not shown any means of relief.",
            "Finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal has not sheltered everyone equally under his umbrella. He has handed the umbrella over to the businesspeople. They have been given all sorts of tax exemptions.",
            "He has further strengthened the policy he adopted to protect the local industries. He has spoken of further stimulus. His expectations are a lot like this -- these measures will increase investment, that will create more employment, people will get work and incomes will increase.",
            "This will bring relief to people's lives. It is a lot like that outdated defunct trickle-down theory. So while the 2022-23 budget is more business-friendly than ever, it has failed to provide relief to the common people. It has failed to be people-friendly.",
            "The finance minister's budget has acknowledged the crisis that looms large. In the chapter on 'Global crisis and the challenge for Bangladesh', he mentions 'salt being rubbed into the wound'. He said that import costs have gone up, remittance has gone down, there is inflation, and the government's subsidy management is under unprecedented pressure. He mentioned a few strategies to overcome the crisis, but the problem is in implementation.",
            "In his budget speech, that finance minister said that the challenges must be tackled very strategically. After all, if one certain problem can't be resolved correctly, this can have damaging repercussions on the macro-economy.",
            "He said, \"Our main strategy will be to reduce the present demand growth and increase supply. That means import-dependent and less important public expenditure will be stopped or curtailed. Implementation of low priority projects will be slowed down and, at the same time, implementation of the mid and high priority projects will be accelerated. The price of energy fuel, gas, power and fertiliser will be adjusted gradually and on a small scale. In order to strengthen the revenue collection drive, collection will be brought under an automation process. The Value Added Tax and income tax net will be expanded. Import of luxury and non-essential items will be discouraged and under or over-invoicing will be carefully monitored. The taka exchange rate against the dollar will be kept at a competitive level.\"",
            "The present global crisis has been created by supply. And inflation has increased due to the supply crisis and expenditure. The finance minister did not explain how demand will be reduced to overcome the crisis. And if this is reduced, then there will be apprehensions on how to achieve the 7.5 per cent GDP growth target set by the finance minister. After all, the basis of the country's GDP is spending and consumerism.",
            "On the day the budget was presented in the US last year, President Joe Biden tweeted, \"Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.' That means it is not just enough to declare a budget. It is more important where the money is spent. Therein lies our finance minister's crisis.",
            "Almost all the revenue expenditure goes in the payment of salaries, allowances, grants and aid, subsidies and interest. And this time the finance minister is having to struggle with subsidies. In the current 2021-22 financial year, allocation for the subsidy sector was Tk 535.82 billion (Tk 53,582 crore). Subsidy costs on oil, electricity, gas and fertiliser have gone up due to increased prices in the international market. As a result, the allocation in the revised budget will be Tk 66,825 crore taka. And in the new budget that will increase further to Tk 82,745 crore. The finance minister said, given the present trends, expenditure in this sector may go up even further by 15 to 20 per cent. He admitted that this was a major challenge in the budget management of the 2022-23 fiscal.",
            "The finance minister has had to come up with another massive budget under the pressure of expenditure. Under the proposed budget, expenditure has been fixed at Tk 6 lakh 78 thousand 64 crore. Of this, Tk 4 lakh 11 thousand 406 crore is in the non-development sector and the remaining Tk 2 lakh 59 thousand 617 crore is development expenditure. The overall deficit in the finance minister's budget is Tk 2 lakh 45 thousand 64 crore and a large portion of this will come from domestic sources. That includes a maximum Tk 1 lakh 6 thousand 334 crore from the banking sector. In the revised budget of the current fiscal this borrowing was supposed to be Tk 87 thousand 287 crore. The question is, if the government borrows such a huge amount from the banking system, how much will be left for the private sector?",
            "In the new financial year, Bangladesh will have to repay Tk 17,000 crore in foreign debts. And the government will have to pay around Tk 19.2 per cent of the non-development budget to pay interest on domestic and foreign loans. Other than this, of the total expenditure, 17.7 will go to the salary and allowance sector, 17.2 per cent for subsidies and stimulus and 16.1 per cent to aid grants.",
            "After spending all this, there will be very little left in the finance minister's hands. Income isn't increasing at the rate of expenditure. The finance minister has, though, taken credit for increasing revenue income in this budget comparison to the past. The revenue target in this 2021-22 financial year was Tk 3 lakh 89 thousand crore. The finance minister said, not a single taka was lessened in the revised budget, that means, the entire revenue collection target will be achieved.",
            "At the same time, he himself said that till last March Tk 2 lakh 70 thousand 639 crore has been collected. That means in the last three month another Tk 1 lakh 18 thousand 361 crore has to be collected. The question is, how much will actually be collected finally. Based on this, the finance minister has drawn up the budget for the new financial year with a massive revenue target to Tk 4 lakh 33 thousand crore. So the common people will bear the brunt of this tax pressure.",
            "Many years ago Benjamin Franklin had said, \"In this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes.\" Many people joke about this, saying death comes but once, but taxes come around every year. As it has this time too.",
            "As always, the finance minister's budget speech lengthy too. It had 172 pages with 343 chapters. In Chapter 114 the finance minister elaborated the revenue details. Never in the past had any of the finance minister used so many pages on the revenue regimen. Perhaps the finance minister will take Benjamin Franklin's words to heart and made taxes a constant in people's lives. With a slight sense of despondence the finance minister commented, even though the middle class and above total around 40 million (4 crore) in the country, most of them do not pay taxes. The finance minister has placed emphasis on income tax in the budget.",
            "The finance minister mentioned that tax exemption was the main obstacle to improving the tax-GDP ratio. He has curtailed the rate of tax exemption in the budget but has kept the tax-free income ceiling at Tk 300,000 as before. He has given in to the demands of the business circles and has lowered corporate tax by 2.5 per cent, conditionally. That means, to avail corporate tax facilities, all transactions must be done through the banking system. Those who avoid bank transactions in order to evade taxes, will not be pleased with this.",
            "Again, TIN used to be enough to avail several types of government service or in the case of large purchases. But the finance minister has made the life of these TIN holders tough too. According to the new budget proposal, now attestation of the returns has to be submitted to avail 38 types of services. This includes for loan applications of over Tk 500,000, buying Savings Certificates of over Tk 500,000, getting a credit card, becoming a director or shareholder in any company, becoming a member of any business association, sending one's child to an English medium school, getting a firearms licence, etc.",
            "In 1996 after Awami League came to power, in order to expand IT, all types of duty were withdrawn from computers. The finance minister has changed that. He has placed tax on the import of laptops. Wealthy businessmen have taken up gold business in the country. The finance minister has facilitated them by withdrawing advance tax in gold imports. And he has come up with special concessions for those siphoning off funds abroad, those who have bought homes and other assets overseas. If they bring back money they took abroad or declare this and pay taxes, the finance minister said this will be accepted with no questions. The question arises, for whom is this scope being made in the year before the election? The finance minister is being praised for measures such as disconnecting the power, water, gas and other utility connections of VAT defaulters and for steps for loans defaulters to pay tax.",
            "The finance minister has said, he has taken certain matters into consideration in drawing up these tax proposals. These include reviving the pandemic-hit economy, creating investment and employment, saving foreign currency, diversifying export-oriented industries, stimulus to backward-linkage industries, developing the health, agriculture, fisheries, livestock, electronics, ICT sectors, expanding heavy industries, making business easier, increasing foreign exchange and developing local industries.",
            "The parliamentary session began at 3:00pm Thursday afternoon. presided over by Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury. Then the finance minister AHM Mustafa Kamal rose to present the budget in the parliament.",
            "He said, he would present the budget by means of the audiovisual media and took the Speaker's permission to present it in this manner.",
            "President Md Abdul Hamid sat in the gallery reserved for him and watched the budget presentation. Earlier in the afternoon, the budget had been approved at a special meeting of the cabinet in the Sangsad Bhaban. Later President Md Abdul Hamid signed the proposal.",
            "As always, this time too the biggest challenge is implementing the budget. This challenge has been made even more difficult by the global crisis. People want relief from the situation, they hope for a decrease in living expenses. And the finance minister has placed everything on the shoulders of the common people. He said, \"The lifeblood of our economy is the ability of our common people to turn around as well as strong and bold leadership.\" So the common man will now have to think like the poet Mirza Ghalib who wrote, \" The skies turn across heaven day and night. Something is bound to happen, so why should I worry?\"",

One, in the budget speech there is some sort of an acknowledgement of the ensuing crisis in economy; two, there is an absence of coordinated mid-term steps to face these crises; three, there is no coherent changes between the budget and the income and expenditure structure. Whatever little there is in the income structure , is non-existent in the expenditure structure.",

Overall, the government is trying for structural reforms. There is an attempt to bring consistency in tax rate at the level of production and business.",

Only 1.83 per cent of GDP is allocated to the education sector; health sector got only 0.83 per cent of GDP and 0.84 per cent of GDP is allocated to social safety nets.",

On the other hand, the projection of GDP growth remains unchanged at 7.5 per cent. As a result, the calculation of the GDP, which is not an indicator of real economic situation, has turned into a sort of political indicator. Once again my analogy between the GDP and a flyaway kite is proven.",

The corporate tax rate has been decreased but at the same time, the tax-free income ceiling at the individual level has not been increased – which highlights a narrowness in the government’s outlook.",

Such a decision would raise questions in this financial year that is approaching the election (12th parliament election), especially when illegal wealth of expatriates is being probed into. The significance of such a step is greater at this time.",
            "Also there is doubt as to whether the money would be brought back following this step. Neither is it certain whether anyone would believe this. This proposed step indicates who are the most influential quarters in the government – when the poor people would not get more than 1 per cent of GDP as allowance from social safety net, the influential quarter would get the opportunity to bring back their laundered money from abroad.",

        "date": "31 May 2022",
        "content": [
            "The dollar crisis in the economy has not abated. Increased import expenditure has led to increased trade deficit. Inflation is on the rise as well. What is the way out of the situation? Ekushey Padak winning economist and former teacher of Chittagong University's department of economics, Muinul Islam, talks to Prothom Alo about ways to overcome the situation and other aspects of the predicament.",
            "Why did the dollar crisis exacerbate so suddenly?",
            "To the apparent eye it may seem that the dollar crisis emerged simply because of increased expenditure in imports. But that is not so. It is true that after the corona crisis, the price of commodities had increased globally. After the Russia-Ukraine war broke out, the prices of fuel oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), edible oil, wheat and many other commodities shot up. This pushed up import costs. But the increase in import costs cannot be solely blamed for the dollar crisis.",
            "No one takes two factors into consideration here. During the corona outbreak, the 'hundi' (illegal money transfer) had more or less come to a halt. After corona came under control, the 'hundi' business is back in full swing. Capital is being siphoned out of the country by means of 'hundi'. Also, taking advantage of increased prices of commodities worldwide, funds are also being sent out of the county by means of over-invoicing. So along with increased import costs, these two factors are also major reasons behind the dollar crisis.",
            "Decrease in remittance and increase in import costs has also pushed up the trade deficit. What impact could this have?",
            "There may be a deficit of 30 billion dollars (3000 crore dollars) in import-export trade in the current account this time. With the increase in 'hundi' it will not be possible to make this up through overseas remittance. Even taking capital account into consideration, I apprehend a 5 billion dollar or 500 crore dollar deficit at the end of the year. In 2001 our reserves had fallen to 1.9 billion dollars (190 crore dollars). From there it has increased to 48 billion (4800 crore dollars0 in August 2021. This was followed by a downward trend and reserves fell to 41 billion dollars (4100 crore dollars). It now has gone up and exceeded 42 billion dollars (4200 crore dollars).",
            "If the trade deficit is to be decreased, strict control on imports must be enforced. Also, the difference between the price of dollars in the kerb market and that fixed by Bangladesh Bank must be reduced. This difference in no way must exceed three or four taka. The wider this difference grows, the more the propensity to send remittance through informal channels will increase. It must be noted that alongside controlling import expenditure, if the trade deficit can be met with overseas remittance, Bangladesh will not fall into danger.",
            "The government is taking several measures. It has imposed additional taxes in the import of non-essential and luxury goods. It has widened the margin in the case of opening letters of credit (LC). How do you evaluate these measures?",
            "Stern control must be imposed in the import of luxury and non-essential commodities. The National Board of Revenue's decision to increase duty on luxury items is very good. More steps like this must be taken. The margin for opening letters of credit for certain items has been increased, but that is not enough. This was to be extended further. Any measures can be taken to control imports strictly to overcome the dollar crisis for the time being. Again, attention must be paid so that there is no over invoicing in import trade. It won't do to think that adopting one of two measures will fix everything. Capital flight must also be strictly controlled.",
            "What can the government do to bring a halt to capital flight?",
            "The main destination of our capital flight is the US, UK, Canada, Australia, UAE, Singapore, India, Malaysia and Europe. We know about PK Halder smuggling out funds. There are many such big businesspersons, civil servants and politicians who are siphoning off funds. They are draining foreign currency out of the country. The foreign minister once remarked that more than the politicians, it is the bureaucrats who have smuggled out more money to Canada.",
            "It is very easy for them to siphon off funds. The big businessmen have full control over bank loans. They take loans from the banks and sent this overseas. In fact, a large chunk of default loans have been siphoned off abroad. Then of course money is sent out of the country also by showing inflated import costs. According to the Washington-based Global Financial Integrity (GFI), the illicit flow of money out of Bangladesh amounts to 9 billion dollars, that is around 75,000 crore taka, annually. Then there is under-invoicing in the readymade garment sector too. The finance ministry and Bangladesh must put strict monitoring in place to ensure that they bring their export earnings back into the country. The government does not attach due importance to this.",
            "The government can bring a halt to capital flight if it wants. It can send an investigation team of the Anti-Corruption Commission or the finance ministry to the countries to where the money is being sent. They can gather then the identity and all details of the money launderers and take action. Once this initiative is taken, it will be revealed that many persons still in service are involved in this money laundering. It will be easy to take action then.",
            "What is the link between money laundering and default loans?",
            "The actual details about default loans are not coming to the government records. In August 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated default loans to stand at Tk 2.4 trillion billion (Tk 240,000 crore). They didn't make any estimates since then. Added to this will be the loans that have been written off, which amount to Tk 540 billion (Tk 54,000 crore). So default loans stand at Tk 3 trillion (Tk 3 lakh crore). I would say that by now this has exceeded Tk 4 trillion (Tk 4 lakh crore). Even if default loans increase, the banks won't be affected because we have no shortage of deposits. The inflow of deposits is fine. Even if remittance is coming in through illegal channels, it ultimately ends up in the banks. The finance minister has adopted all sorts of measures and swept the default loans under the carpet. Big defaulters have slipped out of the default list by repaying 2 per cent of their loans. A large portion of these default loans will ultimately never be recovered because much of this has gone overseas.",
            "There is no obstacle now to bring in as much remittance as one wants in one go. Bangladesh Bank even issued a circular in this regard. How far will this measure help in overcoming the dollar crunch?",
            "Remittance will certainly go up because of this decision, no doubt, but it will also give scope to whiten money made through corruption. The government has made this easy. Now those who are embroiled in corruption are bringing in their money from outside through their relatives living abroad. They are paying for it in the country with their ill-gotten earnings. The black money of corrupt persons is being whitened. Even so, this decision will lead to an increase in remittance coming in through legal channels during the crisis. However, more steps like increasing incentive for overseas remittance should be taken. Presently there is a 2.5 per cent incentive. This can be increased by another 1 per cent. But care must also be taken so that the exchange rate of the dollar in no way differs by more than three or four taka between the kerb market and the banks.",
            "You have spoken about suspending unnecessary big projects in the present circumstances. What is your reason for this?",
            "I have spoken about suspending projects with which the loan installments can be paid. I said this so that the repayment of our loans along with interest does not become a huge burden. We need to be alert from now. In the present situation, we have to repay foreign loans of 4 billion dollars in 2025. When domestic loans are added to this, then we will need a budget allocation of Tk 1 trillion (Tk 1 lakh crore) to repay the loans with interest. That means there can be no allocation for other sectors. Our foreign loan-GDP ratio is increasing. We can suspend certain unnecessary projects so that does not become unbearable.",
            "The project for a railway line on Padma bridge with Chinese credit is one such project. Then there is the Dohazari-Cox's Bazar railway line with ADB funding. The Dohazari railway line was to be connected to the Bangladesh, India, China and Myanmar BCIM economic corridor. But with India leaving that project, it has lost importance. This railway line won't go up to Myanmar and Kunming. This project is okay for long term, but not for now. The revenue from these two projects will not pay for the loan installments.",
            "The bullet train project is also not right. Presently the Dhaka-Chattogram railway route takes a 63 mile detour around Akhaura-Bhairab. If this can be reduced to 150 miles, then it will be possible to travel from Dhaka to Chittagong in three hours. So why should so much be spent on the bullet train project?",
            "The plan to take up Payra port as a deep sea port was illogical. I have said that repeatedly. It is very good that the government finally moved away from that. It can be a sea port, but it is not appropriate for a deep sea port. The deep sea port at Matarbari in Maheskhali of Cox's Bazar and the bay terminal in Patenga, Chattogram, are both good projects. These will have a good impact on import-export trade. Similarly the China-funded Teesta river dredging project and the Farakka Ganges barrage projects were good projects, but could not materialise due to objections from India. Once the Shahjalal third terminal is done, will there be any need for another airport just 50 miles away? There is also no justification of having an airport in Noakhali.",
            "The US and other countries are trying to control inflation by increasing interest rates. What should we do here?",
            "In economies which do not have syndication and behind-the-scene understanding, it is fine to take measures like increasing interest rates. In our economy, such steps will not be effective at all. As it is, commodity prices are rising in the global market. Traders should be strictly monitored so they cannot take advantage of the situation. The existing monitoring must be stepped up. The competition commission must also be activated. If these measures are taken in monitoring the market, these can help in keeping inflation in control."

The country's economy has reached a satisfactory level. But there is the matter of taking it ahead and making it sustainable. The situation hasn't reached a point of turning into a crisis as in Sri Lanka, but rather than basking in complacence, appropriate measures must be taken. If not, our challenges will push us towards a critical juncture. Our economy is much bigger than that of Sri Lanka. The economic sectors are extensive and the economic activities haven't come to a halt, though have slowed down in certain areas.",

            "As I said, there are many challenges. The main areas of concern are the trade deficit, fall in forex reserves, inflation, disparity in income and wealth, employment, health, education and social security. The budget is coming at a distinctive time. This calls for a special budget outside of the conventional income-expenditure calculations. It will not be possible to resolve the problems in one year, but the budget must contain specific implementable policies and strategies to tackle the problems and the challenges. Focus must be placed on accelerating economic activities, equitable development, improving people's living standards, ensuring economic stability and laying the foundation for sustainable development. The efficiency, integrity and initiatives of all government organisations, regulatory authorities and development-related institutions must be increased. The market, banks and other financial institutions must be more efficient, dynamic and supportive of development.",

It is imperative to ensure proper monitoring, good governance and, above all, certain essential reforms.

            "One after the other scandal is taking place due to no accountability and no speedy administrative or legal action. Criminal persons and those with criminal propensity are encouraged by the lack of monitoring and the delays in taking due action. That is unwarranted. The Sonali Bank MD and others have been convicted. That is good, but it took over a decade. And there are so many more persons who have not been brought to justice. The trials of many others remain unfinished. With delayed investigations, the incidents are soon forgotten. Speedy trials are required now with provision for punishment where due.",

Its monitoring has to be stepped up. The audit, inspection, vigilance, on-site and off-site departments should take more timely action. If there is any irregularity or discrepancy in any bank, the central bank must take speedy action. The reserve heist is being investigated, but to the apparent eye it seems that the central bank's monitoring and vigilance was weak. After the matter came to light, it was imperative to coordinate with the concerned authorities and take action. The measures were taken later on and we are having to wait for the results.",

            "In a market-based economy, it is not correct to enforce interest rates or any exchange rates. We emerged from this system two decades ago. So we must move away from this fixed interest rate. Similarly, there is a plan to fix the dollar exchange rate against the taka. I think that is not correct either. If that is done, it should be just for a very brief period as an emergency measure.",
            "While the corona pandemic couldn't do significant harm to our economy, it has become difficult to overcome the impact of the Ukraine war. The price of almost all essential goods has increased. Do you think the government was adequately prepared? If not, where were the shortcomings?",
            "At present, along with the rise in the prices of essentials, costs of other commodities, such as services and commute, are also increasing. The increase in prices is a lot due to supply. It is natural for prices to increase locally when prices increase in the global market. However, the price hike in the local market is much higher than the rate of increase in prices of imported goods. In the case of local goods, there may be an understanding between the wholesalers and retailers in the supply process. Then there is toll collection at various points, commission extracted by the middlemen, transport costs, etc.",
            "The government's monitoring was weak and timely steps should have been taken. Simply observing the situation and discussing with the traders is not enough. Mobile courts, inspections by the national consumer rights protection directorate, are not long term solutions. There must be constant monitoring of the demand for commodities, supply, stock, import and how much stock there is in government storage.",
            "The value of the dollar is increasing against the taka. How much impact has this had on the commodities market? Do you think the government measures to control inflation have been adequate or not?",
            "With the rise in the value of the dollar, the price of all products we import is increasing and this is having an impact on the products produced in the country and those imported. As to what steps have been taken, I replied to that already. The steps are inadequate. The falling value of the taka against the dollar needs to be reined in. This calls for control on imports, monitoring of the use of foreign currency, and increasing remittance and export earning into the country. If necessary, a drive can be taken to bring in dollars to the country though FD schemes.",
            "Had the value of the taka against the dollar been artificially inflated all these days?",
            "Bangladesh Bank should have been alert beforehand about the dollar value. Certain temporary measures have been adopted like stimulus to bring in export earnings, remittance, etc. But the time has come to look into demand, supply, inflation and the currency value of countries related to our overseas trade, and correctly reassess the value of the taka. I do not think that anything has been done with the dollar value to display an inflated per capita income.",

            "The governance, transparency and accountability of Bangladesh's banks are not satisfactory. The appointment of their directors, their policies and recommendations are not always neutral or based on information. That is why in many instances, granting loans, exempting interest and such are not justified. The managing directors and their colleagues often face interference from the directors and from outside. The owners of many industrial groups are on the boards of banks. They may not take facilities from their own banks, but can take this from other banks.",
            "Most importantly, the central bank must monitor whether its financial and management regulations are being followed or not. It is important that the central bank adopt a stern stance.",

            "Four indicators certainly have an impact on the economy. At present, the inflation and the exchange rate is a matter of concern for us. I have already said how to overcome this. Development of the banking sector, effectiveness of the currency market, justification of government borrowing from the banks will bring the interest rate to a reasonable level. It will not be right to keep it at a fixed rate. The growth rate is more or less satisfactory, but these above mentioned factors must be given due importance to keep it that way. Growth rate is just an indicator, not the only determinant of a person's living standards. Social development-equity indicators are also important along with growth.",
            "The government expects revenue collection of Tk 4.33 trillion (Tk 4 lakh 33 thousand crore) in the next financial year. We note that in one decade alone, Tk 4.25 trillion (Tk 4.25 lakh) crore has been siphoned off overseas. So, eventually, how successful will this revenue collection actually be?",
            "In our budget, revenue collection is always a big problem. Spending is no matter at all, it is done through certain processes. We have to see how far we can use our sources of income. Indirect tax, that is VAT, can be collected easily. It is direct taxes, that is, income tax, that is not collected properly. Our tax collection is lower than that of India, even than Nepal. People here evade income tax. Businesspersons in particular do not pay taxes properly.",
            "Waste of money is another matter. Money is being siphoned off, but also excess funds are being spent on huge projects. The term of five-year projects are extended to ten years. Time extensions mean increased costs. Padma bridge construction was supposed to have cost Tk 100 billion (Tk 10,000 crore). That has been increased to Tk 300 billion (Tk 30,000 crore). I have no idea what will eventually happen about the Rooppur project. So if revenue is to be collected successfully, all these matters must be taken into cognizance.",
            "The government is taking steps in the next budget to bring back money laundered abroad. But why couldn't we stop money laundering? Has the central bank been able to carry out is responsibilities in this regard?",
            "The reason that money laundering has not stopped is mismanagement in the financial sector, corruption and lack of monitoring. Above all, another reason is no action being taken despite information about the money being siphoned off. The prevailing laws of the country, international laws, direct communication with foreign countries and legal measures are all essential factors. With integrated and speedy efforts of the government, the central bank, BFIU, the law enforcement and the Anti-Corruption Commission, money laundering can be prevented and the laundered money can be brought back. But more attention should be paid to preventing money laundering. That is basic. How will you being back the money of those whose names have appeared on Panama Papers? There is a matter of international laws. Unless you make a list of those who have laundered money and identify them, the laundering will not stop.",

It has put forward 35 cases against him and the others. Charge sheets will be submitted shortly too. It was ACC's decision to issue a warrant and also to put up a red alert through Interpol.

            "Capital flight has become a big obstacle to the economic development of Bangladesh for the last one decade. Although the gross domestic product (GDP) is gradually increasing, the GDP growth rate is registering only one to one and half per cent due to increased flight of capital from the country. The ratio of private sector investment and GDP is revolving around 23 per cent. On the contrary the ratio of government investment and GDP has crossed 9 per cent in the last one decade. That is why the GDP rate is not decreasing. ",
            "These money launderers are the number one enemy. If they would not have siphoned off money, Bangladesh would have left not only India but also Sri Lanka far behind. The country could be at the top in terms of per capita income. That is why the government and all Bangladeshis at home and abroad should detest, boycott and resist them.",
            "Many may not know, but back in the day Bengal had been a most resourceful region in the Indian sub-continent for several hundred years before the British India Company made Bengal a colony. World renowned explorer Ibn Battuta, who had come to this country during the reign of Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah, first gave this recognition. For the second time, this recognition appeared in historic narratives of famous historian Abul Fazl of Moghul Emperor Akbar's 'Navratna' Durbar.",
            "In his book Akbarnama, he acknowledged that the most resourceful province is 'Subha Bangla' in the Indian sub-continent during the rule of Akbar. Later, the recognition was given by François Bernier who was court physician of Aurangzeb.",
            "According to Bernier, while Egypt had the reputation as the most resourceful region in the world, Bengal was the real claimant of that honour during the 17th century. Within a few days, another French businessman Tavernier supported Bernier. Tavernier was aware of this region as he came several times for the trade of tannery. The matter gained further currency as Karl Marx quoted this too.",
            "After invasion into Bengal in 1757, British India Company plundered the resources and shipped these to England in the vessels for 100 years. The amount of such plundered cargo was so much that there was a worst ship jam at London port for about three months simply to unload all this booty. US historian Brooks Adams mentioned this too,",
            "As stories of looting in Bengal have been proved in the research of many more historians, this looting has been now named 'The Bengal Loot'. Then East Bengal or East Pakistan became victim of looting, deprivation and capital flight once again for about 24 years as it became a colony internally since 1947. After achievement of independence, Bangladesh was branded as an 'international basket case' and 'bottomless basket' by Henry Kissinger in 1972.",
            "After the looting during two colonies of 214 years, why was the once most resourceful region of the Indian-sub continent humiliated in such a way? If the matter is analysed then it would be clear why I am leveling the launderers as number one enemy of the country.",
            "Inward remittance did not become a factor for economy during the tenure of Bangabandhu. Bangladesh was the most attractive source country of labour for city development activities of the oil exporting countries in the Middle East due to first global oil crisis in 1973. At the end of seventies, the labour migration gained pace.",
            "The labour migration has increased in the last four decades. Alongside the Middle East, migration to other countries increased too since the nineties. In the last 30 years, US, Malaysia, Singapore, Italy, Australia and Canada have been destinations of Bangladeshis. At the end of 2021, it is estimated that number of expatriate Bangladeshis has crossed 13 million.",
            "Corruption and capital flight is the main obstacle to the development of independent Bangladesh. Corruption during the period of Bangabandhu was exceptional as the menace did not turn into a common phenomena although the corruption spread since the post-independence of 1973. Although Ziaur Rahman presented himself as an honest man, corruption and capital plundering started increasing in his regime. Institutional corruption spread during the rule of autocrat Ershad. Since the inception of politics of voting in 1991, the same processes strengthened further.",
            "In the mid eighties, inward remittance started increasing. But at the time smuggling in the country's economy turned a serious problem due to the Ershad government's liberalised import policy implemented six years ahead of India. Informal money transfer or 'hundi' became an easy payment system as smuggling started becoming popular.",
            "Since then, money laundering alongside migration increased steadily. Money laundering is now one of the main crises of economy. In 2021, 13 million expatriates sent remittance of 22 billion dollars. According to estimation of Global Financial Integrity, about 9 billion dollars were laundered from Bangladesh in 2018.",
            "The lion's share of the inward remittance from formal or informal channel will ultimately be deposited in the banks. Although the number of banks increased to 61, the flow of deposit continues. According to a recent estimate of Bangladesh Bank, there is a deposit of Tk 11000 billion in banks. However, the loan default now stands at over Tk 4000 billion.",
            "Additional deposits are being considered the main problem of the banking sector. Taking loans from different banks and laundering money to foreign countries by over invoicing under import business and under invoicing under export prevailed.",
            "Corrupt civil and military bureaucrats, politicians, professionals and new bank owners are involved.",
            "Sending remittance through the banking channel has become easier. But sending remittance through hundi system has become even easier and developed more due to the revolution of information technology. The government recently decided to facilitate Bangladeshi businessmen to invest abroad. The finance minister claims the money laundering will decrease if this is done. In fact this decision will simply conceal money laundering. The ratio of private sector investment-GDP has become stagnant at 23 per cent. The finance minister should give priority to increase this ratio. Encouraging investment in foreign countries will no dispel this stagnancy.",

            "It can't be said with full confidence that the economy is on its way to an all-out recovery. There are still certain uncertainties, worries and threats regarding how things will be in the new year. Some problems are global while some are unique to Bangladesh. Certain questions need to be asked to understand how the economy of the new year will fare.",
            "People’s predictions: A Paris-based market research organisation Ipsos conducted a global survey in early December. The organisation questioned 22,000 people in 33 countries across the world about their predictions for 2022. According to the survey, 61 per cent people predicted the world economy will be better than last year. And 77 per cent people believe they will remain happier this year compared to the previous year. Then again, 56 per cent people think, 80 per cent of the total world population will come under at least a single dose of vaccine though there are some worries over Covid-19. ",
            "The respondents of the survey also raised issues of concern. Of them, 75 per cent think prices of essentials will rise in higher proportion than their income in 2022 while 35 per cent predict that leading share markets of the world will witness a drastic fall in the new year.",
            "Five worries of economy",
            "The US news agency CNBC conducted a survey that included 400 investment officials, analysts and investment managers. Of them, 53 per cent said that the great concern for the economy in 2022 will be inflation. And, 30 per cent see the possible high interest rate, planned by the US Federal Reserve Bank, as a matter of great concern. Also, 17 per cent people think Covid-19 and its subsequent effects are the still major setback for global economy.",
            "Renowned economists, research organisations and wealth managers identify five threats for the new year.",
            "1. Inflation: The great worry or concern for all is inflation. Before the emergence of the Omicron, it was the inflation which was responsible for slowing down the economic recovery.",
            "In early 2021, US predicted 2 per cent inflation. But the year ended with an inflation of 7 per cent. The wage rates in large economies are increasing. Fuel prices are likely to go up due to Russia-Ukraine tensions. The incidence of natural calamities is rising too due to climate change. As a result, food prices to see a massive hike. So, there are worries over inflation.",
            "2. Omicron: Omicron, the new variety of Covid-19 which was identified in South Africa first, is still raising concern over the world economy. Many things depend on how fatal the Omicron will be.",
            "3. Interest rate: Investment will be hampered if interest rates are raised are to check inflation. The dollar value will go up. Normally, a monetary policy is prepared by the Fed considering inflation and employment.",
            "4. Share market: The majority of people think that profits from share market investment will be less in the new year.",
            "5. Disparity: The latest threat is that the world economy will recover, but it will not happen in all countries equally. The disparity between countries and between people will widen.",
            "Five questions for the country",
            "How will Bangladesh's economy fare? The country’s economy is at the recovery stage. But this depends on five issues -- how well the recovery will be managed or whether it will lag behind.",
            "How much will inflation rise? How fatal will Omicron be? How much of stimulus will be back in the banks? How will world trade emerge? And will money be invested or siphoned off?",
            "1. Inflation: Like other countries, inflation is increasing in Bangladesh. The inflation rate is around 6 per cent. The majority of the people belong to the poor income group. Many of them lost their savings due to Covid-19. In this situation if inflation keeps rising, the poor along with the people who went under the poverty line recently, will bear the brunt.",
            "2. Characteristics of Omicron: It is necessary to know the characteristics of Omicron as Bangladesh does not have ability to endure another set of rules and regulations or any lockdown.",
            "3. Bank: Again, the majority of the stimulus was bank loans. If not returned, this will become default loans and the banks will face of deficit in new funds for investment. Moreover, problems will multiply if any influential quarter demands exemption from repaying the loan. It is important to keep the financial sector vibrant.",
            "4. Exports: Undoubtedly, economic recovery depends on world trade. Supply crunch makes the world trade a lag behind at bit. But till now, Bangladesh is doing well. While remittance from overseas dropped to an extent, export revenue grows.",
            "5. Capital flight: The last question is, is the money amassed by some people being invested here or being siphoned off? The problem is that the authorities, including the finance minister, do not know who launders the money. So the trend of siphoning off money is a great concern right now.",
            "In conclusion: Nobody in 2019 could predict how 2020 would be. With the emergence of the Covid-19 vaccine, it was assumed that the disease will be under control and everything will be back to normal.",
            "Many hope that this variant of coronavirus will not be fatal. Every vaccine available in the markets will be effective as a booster dose. There will be no global vaccine supply shortage. They hope prices of commodities will go down and that life will be normal again. It is difficult to determine how much of our expectations will come true. We simply have to hope for the best."

        "date": "30 Nov 2021",
        "content": [
            "Back in the mid-nineteenth century in the US, it was a common practice in bars to offer customers a “free lunch” as long as they bought a beer or any such alcoholic drink. The free meal included salted ham, cheese and crackers, for which the customers would surely order a beer to drink with such salty food. And the clever bar owners would cover the cost of the meal with the price of the drinks. So there really is no such thing as a free lunch. Later the Nobel Prize winner for economics, Milton Friedman, even wrote a book by that name. The bottom line is to get anything, you have to pay a price. What is free to the apparent eye, will have to be paid for by someone now or later, whether it is economic decorum or offence.",
            "The list of economic offences over the last decade or so is long indeed. Many have glossed it over as the inevitable costs of development, nothing to sweat over. But now it is seen that there is no escape from past misdeeds and the brunt must be borne. The chickens have come home to roost. Even though it is common knowledge, some of the misdeeds have been broadly presented here.",
            "Default loans have gone up by five times in just a matter of 12 years. The default bank loans in the country now exceed Tk 1 trillion (Tk 1 lakh crore). And a substantial amount of this has been siphoned off abroad. According to the Washington-based research organisation, Global Financial Integrity, around USD 6 billion was siphoned out of Bangladesh in 2015 by means of underhand business manipulations. In Bangladeshi currently that amounts to around Tk 500 billion (Tk 50 thousand crore).",
            "Money has been sent out of Bangladesh in two ways. One way is by over invoicing when importing goods. The other way is under-invoicing when exporting goods. This money could have built quite a few Padma bridges and metro-rails. And the government is being deprived of import duty and income tax.",
            "At a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), the construction costs of the coal-fired Matarbari power plant project was increased by Tk 158.70 billion ( Tk 15 thousand 870 crore) and the time extended by three and a half years. Matarbari is no exception. The costs and time of all projects, including the Padma bridge project, have been unimaginably increased. The objective of development projects is to increase national resources. But such inflated costs and extended deadlines, decrease rather than increase resources.",
            "The share market crashed in 2010-11 and the manipulators made off with Tk 50 billion (Tk 5000 crore). Small investors were devastated. The share market in Bangladesh saw a similar crash in 1996. Awami League was in the government at that time too. The same trend continues now. The prime minister’s private industry and investment advisor Salman F Rahman himself has said that the shares of non-productive companies and closed factories are being manipulated in the share market under the very eyes of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). But DSE is doing nothing. DSE brokers are manipulating the market and increasing the share prices of closed companies in front of DSE.",
            "As a result of such manipulations investors are losing everything. Investors are turning away from the share market.",
            "The time has come to pay for these financial discrepancies. The problem is, others are having to bear the brunt of these misdeeds. Those who are liable for these underhand manipulations are out of reach – in Canada, America or Europe. The liability has fallen on the shoulders of the innocent public. Let’s see how the cost of these financial misdeeds are being covered.",
            "In order to keep up its unreined spending, the government has cut down the interest rates of saving certificates (Sanchay Patra). This has been done in order to cut down on the government’s loan expenditure lessens. It is the hapless low-income retired persons who are bearing the brunt.",
            "The price of diesel and kerosene has recently been increased by Tk 15 per litre. The reasons behind this have been shown as increased oil prices in the international market, BPC’s losses and smuggling to neighbouring India. The fact of the matter is that the government needs funds to continue with its economic injustice. And this has been done, bypassing the public hearing process of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, which in itself is a paper tiger. The price of oil has increased the burden on everyone from the farmers to the middle class citizens. Increased inflation is inevitable.",
            "I do not say that the price of fuel oil will always remain static. Oil prices always fluctuate in the international market. According to Macrotrends, the price of unrefined oil per barrel in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was USD67.74, USD39.68 and USD 56.99 respectively. So the questions is, if the increase in international market prices are being used as an excuse to push up the price of fuel here, why weren’t the prices slashed when the international prices were nearly halved in 2020? And now where is the profit made by BPC at the time?",
            "Let me share my own experience. In 1991 the Energy Regulatory Commission still hadn’t been formed. The finance division and the energy ministry together would determine the price of fuel oil. I worked at the National Board of Revenue at the time. Fixing the price of oil was in no way a part of my duty, even though the matter of duty and taxes did have a role in determining this price. Dr Akbar Ali Khan had just been shifted from being the NBR chairman to become the secretary of the finance division. He summoned a meeting which I joined as a representative from NBR. It was decided at the meeting that I would prepare a position paper on the matter. A general manager of BPC would help me with information on import costs, shipment costs and other details, while the finance division would provide me with information on possible subsidies. Being requested by my former boss and out of my own interest, I agreed to take up the task.",
            "I presented three different price estimates at the next meeting and one was taken up. I used the Lotus 1-2-3 programme at the time to create a model of projected fuel costs. In this model, if you entered the average import costs, local and international transportation costs, duty and taxes, subsidies and other relevant data, it would automatically determine the price of fuel oil. I suggested this to be used to determine the price of fuel a few times every year. Everyone at the meeting, including the energy secretary Syed Abdus Samad, praised me highly, but till today this proposal has not been implemented. Yet in neighbouring India and many other countries such formulas are being used to regularly adjust the price of oil.",
            "If the share market is to be revived, those responsible for the last two crashes must be brought to book in order to restore the faith of the investors. Also, party affiliates must be dropped from the commission leadership and replaced with professionals with strong backbones. Interest rates on deposits and loans must be determined by the market. Inflations must be decreased to reduce interest rates. Under the social safety net programme, there must be special arrangement for investing in saving certificate (sanchay patra) for retired persons and members of the middle class as well as charitable organisations.",
            "The reins must be pulled in economic offences and government expenditure. Loan defaulters must be brought back to the country and given exemplary punishment. The people are tired of paying for the free lunches of the beneficiaries of economic offences. This must come to an end immediately.",

Another case was filed against Rafiqul Amim on charge of not submitting wealth statement. Last year, a lower court sentenced him to three years in jail in this case. Rafiqul Amim appealed to the High Court against the sentence.",
            "The two cases filed against Rafiqul Amin and others over money embezzlement and laundering charges are pending trial at Dhaka Special Judge Court-4. Trial proceedings are at the final stage in one of the cases while recording of witness deposition is underway in another one.",
            "Since being arrested in October 2012, Rafiqul Amin had been in hospital’s prison cell from time to time. He mainly stayed at the BSMMU and also stayed at BIRDEM General Hospital at times. Lastly on 11 April, he came to the BSMMU’s prison cell. Rafiqul Amin was transferred back to Dhaka Central Jail after media reported the Destiny boss holding a Zoom meeting from the prison cell.",
            "Eight prison guards including the chief prison guard deployed to escort Rafiqul Amin have been closed. The probe body’s report recommended warning four deputy jailers as well as taking action against 13 prison guards as per the jail code. It said all prison guards facing allegations admitted their faults and gave similar confessions. The probe body has learned that certain Bishwanath Poddar used to visit the prison cell. According to Rafiqul Amin, Bishwanath Poddar was a nurse. He brought Rafiqul Amin’s medicines and groceries and visited him with the permission of the authorities.",
            "According to the investigation report, Rafiqul Amin confessed to probe body that he attended in several question and answer sessions with a group of investors over mobile phone several times in May 2020. These were not Zoom meetings or video calls. He connected through a normal cell phone and answered several questions from 2-3 investors. He didn’t know how many investors were connected but he was told prior to the meeting that 500 investors would join the meeting.",
            "The probe body put forward 19 recommendations to prevent this type of irregularities. These includes installing CCTV cameras in hospitals’ prison cells and corridors, not posting any prison guard who previously faced departmental punishment on duty in hospital, not deploying anyone having experience less than five years as prison guard in prison cells and opening a 200-bed hospital at Kashimpur Central Jail-2 for better treatment of the prisoners.",
            "Inspector general of prisons Brigadier General Md Mominur Rahman Mamun told Prothom Alo recommendations made by the probe body as per the jail code and the prison act will be implemented.",

        "date": "19 Jun 2021",
        "content": [
            "There has been growing discussion on money laundering. Some may call it a 'seasonal' discussion. There are mainly two 'seasons' to discuss money laundering. New York-based Global Financial Integrity (GFI) releases a global report on money laundering in March every year. That's when the discussion on money laundering begins and the government makes its stereotypical promises.",
            "The next time such discussions arise is in June. The Swiss National Bank releases its annual report, “Banks in Switzerland” during this time of the year. It reveals information on the funds deposited in Swiss banks. The report discloses the amount of money without giving the clients’ details.",
            "However, discussion on money laundering now takes place only once, since GFI didn’t release its report for two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. Another discussion on money laundering has already begun before the Swiss banks report. And several lawmakers deserve credit for it. They gave speeches criticising the government’s inaction on money laundering. The finance minister also had to reply to these discussions in parliament’s budget session. And when the the finance minister himself wants to know the names of the money launderers, questions naturally arise about the commitment of the government in this regard.",
            "The Swiss National Bank released a report titled “Annual banking statistics for 2020” on 17 June. According to the report, deposits by Bangladeshis dropped by 6.6 per cent to 563 million (56.3 crore) Swiss francs or about Tk 52.03 billion (5,203 crore) in 2020. One Swiss franc equals to Tk 92.28. The deposits stood at 603 million (60.3 crore) Swiss francs. Deposits by Bangladeshis had declined for three straight years.",
            "All funds deposited in the Swiss banks are not necessarily illegal money. While money channelled through various illegal means from Bangladesh is stashed away in Swiss banks, Bangladeshis living in various countries ariund the world also make depositsthere. That means there are both legal and illegal money in Swiss banks. However, the Swiss banking system is globally known for protecting clients’ confidentiality as per the law of the country. So the number of secret deposits is more.",
            "A fall in deposits by Bangladeshis in Swiss banks for three straight years does not necessarily indicate a decline in money laundering. The Swiss banks don’t have certain privileges as before. Swiss banks couldn’t reveal any client’s details according to the Swiss Banking Act enacted in 1933. Many things changed after the the Obama government in the US passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in 2010. As per the law, Swiss banks are to provide some details of their clients now. Like the US, several European countries have also taken various steps to collect information. Even neighbouring India signed an automatic exchange of information framework agreement with Switzerland. As a result, Swiss banks can’t be as secretive as they were before. Swiss banks are facing growing pressure to shift from the secrecy stance. Besides, new places and sources have been created globally to stash laundered money. There are various ways to keep money by opening companies in countries and territories including Cayman Island, Luxemburg, UK, USA, Singapore and Hong Kong. So, Swiss banks don’t dominate in hidden wealth anymore.",
            "The name of more than 50 businesspersons and companies has appeared in Panama Papers and Paradise Papers released by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). They all siphoned off the money opening offshore companies. Bangladeshi businesspersons also run big businesses in various countries including Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, Thailand, UK and USA. Media has reported on Bangladeshis purchasing houses in Malaysia and Canada. Everyone knows about this. So Swiss banks are not the only way to siphon off money anymore.",
            "Reports reveal Tk 50 billion (5,000 crore) is deposited in Swiss banks whereas, according to GFI, on average, $7.53 billion (753.37 crore) equal to Tk 640 billion (64,000 crore) is siphoned off Bangladesh annually. GFI mainly collects data on money laundering from international trade statistics. They have no data on ‘hundi’, an illegal financial instrument to transfer money from place to place. Experts believe the actual figure will surpass Tk 640 billion. And it is possible to build two Padma bridges every year with this Tk 64 billion.",
            "The matter of money laundering was discussed in parliament. Like this time, prime minister Sheikh Hasina joined the discussion on Swiss banks in parliament in June 2017. At that time, she said, “a list is being prepared on whoever makes deposits in Swiss banks and how much. We will surely bring back the country’s money.” The Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue (NBR) became a somewhat active after the prime minister’s remarks. After that, the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) Bangladesh Bank sent a letter to Switzerland’s financial intelligence unit seeking information on Bangladeshis making deposits in Swiss banks plus singing a memorandum with Swiss National Bank. But no progress has been made so far. The government actually has no effective initiative at all.",
            "Lastly, it can be said the question is about sincerity, determination and political will. The big question is whether the government really wants to catch the money launderers or not. Since we don’t know the answer, the discussion on money laundering will stop this time too after June is over. At one point of the discussion, the government will make some promises like they had made in previous years. Money launderers also know these are just words. So tax evasion will continue. Black money will increase. Bank loans won’t be repaid. Earning from narcotics and arms trade will increase. Government officials will continue to take bribes and carry out corruption. And this money will be laundered to another countries and a portion of it will go to Swiss banks. So there is nothing to be relieved when there is a decline in the funds being kept in Swiss banks.",

            "In a report published on 8 June in Prothom Alo, the finance minister was quoted as saying in parliament, “I do not have the list of money launderers. If you have a list of those laundering money, give it to me.”",
            "In reply, the Prothom Alo editorial on 9 June stated, “If someone wants to look for something with his eyes and ears closed, he will never find it. All you have to do is open your eyes and ears to get the names of those the finance minister is looking for, and it will take commitment from his government to take action against the money launderers.”",
            "It is the finance minister’s responsibility to come up with the list, why will the members of parliament provide it to him? The person who remains asleep while awake, cannot be awakened. Some time back a High Court bench had issued a ruling, asking the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) for names of those siphoning off capital overseas. The honourable judge reprimanded the ACC lawyer for responding to the ruling by submitting a carelessly made list. The court returned the list to him and ordered that relevant investigations be carried out and a proper list be drawn up. The court had observed that money launderers were the enemies of the nation.",
            "A few days after that, during a ‘Meet the Press’ event on 18 November last year, foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said that he had personally undertaken a secret survey of Canada’s ‘Begumpara’ and in 28 samples he noted that the majority of residents in ‘Begumpara’ were not politicians, but civil servants. Of these 28 families, 4 were of politicians and the rest were government officials and readymade garment industrialists.",
            "While the Bangladesh Bank authorities, ACC and CID have several times collected lists of money launderers from the central bank’s Financial Intelligence Unit, nothing has been done. Why did the finance minister not keep track of the sensational money laundering of recent times carried out by PK Halder and Papul? In 2018, the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers published the names of 82 Bangladeshis who siphoned funds out of the country. Does the finance minister not have their names? Is he not aware that the defaulted bank loans are directly linked to capital flight? Even since he became finance minister, he was creating all sorts of facilities for the huge loan defaulters and simply sweeping the loan default crisis under the rug. The volume of default loans is on a steady rise, yet he declared at the parliament’s budget session that this was not important at all.",
            "The question irrevocably arises as to how far the finance minister is actually sincere about controlling corruption, the rise in default loans and the resulting capital flight. The roots of money laundering lie in the unrestrained corruption and increase in default loans. After the assassination of Bangabandhu and family on 15 August 1975, when military ruler Ziaur Rahman took over power, he gave indulgence to political and bureaucratic corruption in the interests of his own politics and to win the loyalty and support of the military and civil bureaucrats.",
            "While corruption has steadily spread since 1973, during Bangabandhu’s rule it was an aberration, not a norm in politics and bureaucracy. But though Zia established himself as an icon of integrity, it was under his indulgence that corruption and money laundering was institutionalised. History points to how, before the defeat in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, Bengal had the most flourishing agro-economy of the Indian subcontinent. But the relentless looting, siphoning out of wealth and exploitation by the British East India Company left that economy devastated for the next 100 years.",
            "American historian Brook Adams says that such huge amounts of wealth were taken back by wooden ships to England from Bengal after 1757, that it would take three months to unload each vessels at the port in London. Historians refer to this as ‘The Bengal Loot.’ It is said that this loot contributed significantly to the first Industrial Revolution of England. The British took over direct rule in 1758, and the looting continued unabated.",
            "In 1947, victim of the British rulers’ partition of India, East Bengal was included as part of Pakistan and for another 24 years was subject to looting, exploitation, pilferage of wealth and unlimited repression. These 214 years of wealth being siphoned out, left the country high and dry and the independent Bangladesh in 1972 was indubitably dubbed as an international basket case. And now these money launderers every year are sending off 7 billion to 9 billion dollars overseas, according to the US-based Global Financial Intelligence.",
            "Dr Momen’s statement indicates that at present, alongside the businessmen, it is the politicians, civil servants of different levels and various professional groups who are principally involved in money laundering. They steadily siphon off the money so that they may live cushy lives with their families in developed countries of the capitalist world. Over invoicing for imports in foreign business deals is one of the most common ploys for money laundering and under invoicing in the case of exports.",
            "Alongside these well-used methods of money laundering, there is the ‘hundi’ system of money transfer commonly used by expatriate Bangladeshis. As this is unofficial, there is no record of how much money is actually sent overseas from the country every year. The remittance flow into the economy, official or unofficial, benefits the economy. But the ‘hundi’ dollars sent overseas are bought by the corrupt black money owners and the bank defaulters. These ‘hundi’ dollars are being used to build up ‘Begumpara’ in Toronto and the ‘second homes’ in Malaysia.",
            "The huge deposits coming in from remittances has prevented the banks from collapsing under the weight of default loans. The disruption of the ‘hundi’ system under the impact of coronavirus over the past 15 months, has brought in waves of remittance through formal channels and kept our GDP growth vibrant. The pandemic has also slowed down the outflow of capital and so in the current fiscal there has been a massive trend of whitening black money. After the pandemic comes under control, money laundering will resume in full force. So if money laundering is to be halted, sincere efforts much be made to stop this corruption and pilferage of capital. If not, even if the government gets the list of money launderers, it will not be able to stop this capital flight.",

The two prominent money launderers who have caused a stir recently are Shahid Islam, a former MP from Lakshmipur-2 constituency and PK Haldar, former managing director of People’s Leasing. A Kuwaiti court has sentenced Shahid Islam to four years in prison for human trafficking and money laundering. He is now in the Kuwait prisons. PK Haldar seized various financial institutions and laundered Tk 35 billion abroad. But the government could not even touch him.",
            "Foreign minister AK Abdul Momen said in November last year that most of those who laundered money from Bangladesh to Canada were government officials. Out of 28 people, only four are politicians. The High Court then asked the ACC for updated information on the money launderers but they could not provide it.",
            "The Awami League government brought some money laundered during the BNP rule and highlighted that over-enthusiastically. The countrymen also applauded their initiative. They hoped the government would close the money laundering loopholes and crack down on launderers. But in reality none of this happened. As a result, millions have been siphoned off the country and it is still continuing.",
            "If someone wants to look for something with his eyes and ears closed, he will never find it. All you have to do is open your eyes and ears to get the names of those the finance minister is looking for, and it will take goodwill from his government to take action against the money launderers. The question is does the government really want to prevent money laundering? Unfortunately, we do not see any such step on the part of the government as yet."

            "Nowadays, nobody denies the incidents of money to foreign countries rather debate continues on who is laundering the money more. ",
            "The foreign minister on 18 November last year told a Meet the Reporters that government officials launder money more than politicians. The six months after the foreign minister’s remarks, now lawmakers during the current session of parliament strongly demanded money laundering must stop.",
            "On Sunday, even a ruling party lawmaker in parliament demanded for stern action to prevent money laundering. On Monday, lawmakers from the opposition said the government isn’t finding out any way to prevent siphoning money off the country and couldn’t also bring back the laundered money. People are laundering money though under invoicing and over invoicing as well as hundi.",
            "Four opposition lawmakers made the disclosure during the discussion on 2020-21 supplementary budget in parliament. On the other hand, finance minister AH Mustafa Kamal sought information on money laundering from the opposition lawmakers. Although foreign minister AK Abdul Momen on 18 November told the newspersons they have secretly collected information on Bangladeshis living in Toronto, Canada. At that time, he said, “I thought that the number of politicians would be higher. I got surprised though the information is not comprehensive. Considering the number, many government officials have houses and their children live there.”",
            "Taking the floor during the discussion on 2020-21 supplementary budget, Jatiya Party Lawmaker Kazi Firoz Rashid said the finance ministry’s leadership is right but his authority is weak. So, all blames shouldn’t be put on the finance ministry like the Bangladesh Bank hasn’t had its authority over the banking sector now. Proper authorities can’t exercise their power in financial institutions and insurance sector too.",
            "Everything runs freely. Director of a bank takes money to another bank. Billions of taka is being shipped off. Money is also being sent through hundi, he added.",
            "Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Firoz Rashid also placed a proposal on the activities of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to prevent money laundering. He said there is no need for the ACC head office in Bangladesh. Let’s set it up in Canada plus opening a branch office in Malaysia. Besides, if more branches open in Australia, Dubai and the USA, then the real scenario of money laundering will be understood, he argued.",
            "The lawmaker also talked about Proshanto Kumar Halder, known as PK Haldar, who siphoned billions of taka off the country by acquiring ownership of many banks and financial institutions. Firoz Rashid said, “PK Haldar took away such a huge amount of money. Yet, it has been said that he escaped arrest just for nine minutes. Why didn’t the authorities concerned detain him nine hours ago?\"",
            "The court even sought a list of the persons who have built houses abroad spending the laundering money, but the ACC couldn’t submit it, Firoz Rashid said. ",
            "He said there is a lack of monitoring despite Bangladesh Bank has so many branches. If audit was carried out in time, this incident wouldn’t happen, such a huge amount of money wouldn’t be laundered and such a large amount of bad loans wouldn’t be disbursed too.",
            "Another Jatiya Party lawmaker Rowshan Ara Mannan said many project directors build and buy houses by name or without name at home and abroad. Recruitment and tender business are being done through project and this must be controlled.",
            "BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid said, “I was good at mathematics at school. Teachers admired me. But, I couldn’t do the equations of the budget. Where will the money come from? We are going after the growth. If the coronavirus isn’t controlled, earning from garment sector and remittance will collapse drastically.”",
            "BNP lawmaker Rumeen Farhana said people’s money remains deposited at banks, but a section of people is taking away this money and they know they won’t have to return it. More than Tk 1 trillion (1 lakh corer) are siphoned off annually due to over invoicing and under invoicing.",
            "In February this year, the lawmaker of Lakshmipur-2 constituency, Shahid Islam, was stripped of his membership in parliament on ground of moral turpitude after a Kuwait court sentenced him to four years' jail in a case related to human trafficking money laundering in January this year. Kuwait police arrested Shahid Islam in June last year.",

            "According to the GFI report, flight of funds increased by trade misinvoicing from Bangladesh since 2008. The highest amount, $11.51billion flew from the country in 2015 while $5.28 billion, $8.9 billion, $7.09 billion, $8 billion, $7.12 billion and $8.82 billion were siphoned off the country in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.",
            "Bangladesh sees capital flight of $5.9 billion or about Tk 500 billion (50,000 crore) through international trade in 2019, according to the GFI.",
            "Bangladesh Bank in a letter sent to the finance ministry’s Financial Institutions Division said money is being laundered abroad under the shadow of import as well as huge amount of foreign countries earned through export aren’t coming to the country. Though cases are filed under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947, but the matter isn’t being resolved.",
            "Favouring the opportunity to whiten money, lawmaker Firoz Rashid said the finance minister has taken the right stance. Those who are sending this money from different countries surely know that no disclosure of this money will be required. So the finance minister shouldn’t be misled by the talk shows. Let the opportunity to whiten money exists.",
            "Citing the mismanagement in the country’s financial sector, BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid said corruption is responsible for it. The prime minister has announced a zero tolerance against corruption. Yet the finance minister talks about the opportunity to whiten the undisclosed money. So, it’s contradictory. Then again, the finance minister said black money and undisclosed money are not same and it’s right as per policy. ",
            "Mentioning a bank has been handed over to a family by amending the Bank Company Act, another BNP lawmaker Rumeen Farhana said looting of public fund is rampant. A list of loan defaulters was placed in parliament and what sort of action was taken against them? she asked.",
            "Rumeen Farhana said no accurate figure of the banking sector’s bad loans is available. When the government said bad loan stood at Tk 1.1 trillion (1.10 lakh crore), at that time the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated it Tk 2.5 trillion (2.5 lakh crore). Now the government said bad loan stands at Tk 880 billion (88,000 crore), she added.",
            "BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid said the capital markets have collapsed completely.",
            "Regarding this, Rumeen Farhana said when Awami League comes to power the capital markets collapse and it happened in 1996 and 2010.",
            "Rumeen added former finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said stock market is in fact a ‘speculative market’. Many a time he (Muhith) spoke frankly. He also said clearance for new banks was given on political consideration.",
            "Jatiya Party lawmaker Rowshan Ara Mannan said banking sector, financial institutions and capital markets have become the oppressed orphans. There is no body to look after them. Looting and corruption is rampant but no one is getting punishment, she added."

        "date": "04 May 2021",
        "content": [
            "There have been huge discourse and criticism in the political arena and among experts after news was published on 25 April that Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) has taken a decision to set up their own bank, insurance companies, universities and medical colleges.",
            "The tenure of the outgoing president is going to end in a few days and setting up bank, insurance companies, universities and medical colleges through a decision taken during his tenure will be regarded as a major contribution in future. As many businesspeople and industrialists including former FBCCI president think the matter of establishing bank as an unusual and unnecessary appeal and it requires some discussion and analysis.",
            "Regarding this, my commentary was published in Porthom Alo on 26 April 2021, in which I have predicted the FBCCI authorities will be given clearance for setting a bank soon. Today, I am going to clarify my stance on the matter.",
            "I call it a 'peculiar appeal' because all owners of the banks in Bangladesh are either leaders or influential members of any business–industrialist group or association affiliated with the FBCCI members. Among them, many families have centralised the ownership of the banks. Even it is also found that those who initially were entrepreneurs and shareholders of a bank jumped to another bank selling their shares at a higher price. Or they laundered the money and flew abroad with their families. ",
            "Settling of politicians and their relatives abroad after making millions of taka through such businesses is very much popular as crony capitalism political culture in the country. Since the majority of business and industrialists’ groups are run under family ownership and management in the country, the main ownership and management of most of the banks have gradually come under sole family control. The recent dispute of brothers and sister over ownership and management of National Bank Limited has brought many incidents to limelight that feud exists among family members over the control of a bank.",
            "Though, shares of the banks are traded at the stock markets as public limited company, but there is no possibility that general shareholders will ever have the control of the banks. Several top businessmen of the country have been buying large number of shares of several banks in various ways using different names. A businessperson from Chattogram is said to have established ownership on seven banks. I don’t know whether any other country provides a legal jurisdiction to establish sole control over bank’s ownership. Several banks have even been established under the ownership of the government’s forces including armed forces, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), police, Ansar and VDP or under the ownership of an NGO.",
            "That’s why some say what fault is there, if FBCCI appeals for a bank. The law doesn’t bar it to do so. The matter seems to be ‘peculiar’ because the bank owners are the targeted group of the country’s businesspeople and industrialists. Despite this, why will FBCCI have to venture into the banking business separately? Who will make profit from it? Aren’t we seeing here one more strategy of the FBCCI leaders to make profit by including some businesspersons, who were earlier dropped, in the new bank?",
            "I have been conducting research on the banking sector in Bangladesh since 1998 when I was the director general of Bangladesh Institute of Management (BIM) for three years. Currently, 61 banks operate in Bangladesh with process underway for several others to get license. Such banks weren’t established for economic purposes, rather these have been set up for political purpose and nepotism. Other than the leaders, activists and supporters who are blindly loyal to Awami League, majority of the country’s people will admit many banks have been set up in the country than required. The importance of economic interest was not given when the various matters have been considered to give license for banks after the grand alliance came to power in 2009. Had the existing banks been encouraged to expand their branches to provide services in remote areas across the country instead of establishing new banks, this facility would have been achieved at a very low cost.",
            "If fact, new banks have been set up only for the urge of crony capitalist politics and nepotism even after knowing the facts that number of the banks are more than required. Objection raised by Bangladesh Bank have been ignored repeatedly. The central bank continues to play role of a helpless spectator. There are several political leaders’ close relatives among those lucky people who have got easy way to become millionaire after securing license to own a bank. Many people may not notice that no matter how serious the crisis of default loan is in the country’s banking sector. Almost all private commercial banks have been making huge profit every year.",
            "So, those who have managed to secure license for bank have become the owner of millions of taka easily because of profit share. For this reason, this political corruption of distributing bank ownership is a classic example of corny capitalism. Many of these bank-entrepreneurs have got the license to establish bank because of political connection and nepotism. They then have become entrepreneurs and directors of the banks without the capital since other businesspersons invested the money. That means majority of capital invested in their shares might have been paid by other directors of the banks. Majority of these directors are businesspersons and industrialists, who have gained sole control over the bank loans getting the ownership of the banks. The culture of loan swap among banks has reached a terrible level although the Bank Company Act imposes various rules and regulations on getting loan from their own banks.",
            "Everyone knows that loan default is the most serious problem of the banking sector in Bangladesh. According to the IMF, as of June 2019, loan default in Bangladesh stood at a staggering Tk 2.4 trillion (240,167 crore). The amount included Tk 1.12 trillion (112,425 crore) classified loans as mentioned by Bangladesh Bank, Tk 792.42 billion (79,242 crore) loans that remain pending due to court’s injunction, Tk 271.92 billion (27,192 crore) of special-mention accounts and Tk 213.08 billion (21,308 crore) rescheduled loans. After adding bad loans worth Tk 544.63 billion (54,463 crore) that was written off until June 2019, the total amount of default loan reached nearly 3 trillion (300,000 crore).",
            "No borrower has been being declared a loan defaulter over last 14 months since coronavirus pandemic broke out in March of 2020 and Bangladesh Bank is not publishing any details on default loans. I wouldn’t be surprised even if the amount of default loans increases to Tk 5 trillion (500,000 crore) now. Deposit continues to pour in at banks overshadowing this grave crisis of the banking sector. As long as the wave of remittance by the expatriate Bangladeshis continues, the surge in deposit in banks will remain. Downtrend in investment because of coronavirus pandemic has also been added to it. As a result, excess liquidity of the banks has surpassed Tk 1.5 trillion (150,000 crore). Amid this circumstance, if FBCCI gets clearance for another bank I wouldn’t be surprised.",

The character of a certain class of the ruling party’s leaders and activists was exposed during the drive against casinos in Dhaka in 2019. But then the drive came to a halt for unknown reasons.",

The two brothers Barkat and Rubel used them to create a business of controlling and taking commissions for all tenders of Faridpur district roads, PWD, LGED, health, BRTA, the pourashavas, electricity, the zila parishad, facilities, the Water Development Board, the Tepakhola livestock market, the C&B terminal and the medical college hospital. They also made money from drug trade, extortion in the transport sector and taking commission for documents in the district registrar’s office.",
            "They then began to forcefully grab land from hapless people, paying them pittance. They used the land as mortgage, inflating the value to take bank loans. They have outstanding bank loans of Tk 1.71 billion (Tk 171 crore). They used this wealth to buy huge amounts of property in Faridpur and Rajbari in an attempt to whiten their black money. Investigations have revealed 487 documents of 5,288 acres of land in the name of Barkat, Rubel, their wives, brother, father-in-law and mother. The value of this land is estimated to be around Tk 3.93 billion (Tk 392 crore 76 lakh).",
            "In the four years from 2017 to 2020, Barkat and Rubel got 475 work contracts from LGED, worth around Tk 8.12 billion (Tk 812 crore 26 lakh). At the time, the two brothers had around Tk 29.11 billion (Tk 2,910 crore 71 lakh) in 188 bank accounts. Of this, no legitimate source of wealth was found for around Tk 25.35 billion (Tk 2,535 crore 11 lakh). Around 5,388 bighas of their land, their business companies and other items as well as Tk 97.5 million (Tk 9.75 crore) deposited in banks, have been confiscated.",
            "Plaintiff in the case, CID inspector SM Miraz Al Mahmud said, “Investigations are underway about the remaining 41 as associates in the crimes. If their involvement is proven, a supplementary charge sheet will be submitted to the court.”",
            "On 25 February the court ordered 5,706 bighas of land of Barkat and Rubel to be seized. The court also ordered the around Tk 100 million (Tk 10 crore) in 188 bank accounts to be confiscated too. Also, the court issued directives for 55 buses, truck and personal cars that they owned to be seized.",
            "The charge sheet said that 67 vehicles and other items, 5,388 bighas of land and Tk 97.5 million have been confiscated.",
            "On the night of 16 May last year, attacks were launched twice on the house of Faridpur district Awami League president Subal Chandra Saha. Nine persons including Rubel and Barkat were arrested on 7 June in a case filed in this regard. That brought an end to the domination of Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and his family in the political arena of Faridpur. This case is seen to be a turning point in the political scenario of the district known for its traditional politics.",

            "Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled gave an interview to Prothom Alo’s Shawkat Hossain and Sanaullah Sakib about various issues of the banking sector at the office of Kochi-Kanchar Mela in Segunbagicha, Dhaka on 24 August 2020. Prothom Alo published the interview of 4 September that year. That was the last interview of the former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank that Prothom Alo published. Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled breathed his last under treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) on this morning (Wednesday). In honour of the noted banker Prothom Alo republishes the interview.",
            "When Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled worked in the banking sector back in the sixties, they had no idea about anything called ‘default loan’. Now the banks are weighed down upon heavily by the burden of default loans.",
            "Talking about his experience, he said, “I was on training in Karachi in 1963, I had joined Habib Bank. During our training we weren’t taught much about loan default. Only towards the end there was a topic on default loans. In the afternoons we would be taken to the bank branch to see practically whatever we were taught. Someone had been given the responsibility to decide on which branch we would be taken. We would normally be taken to a mid-sized branch which wouldn’t be too crowded. But this gentleman couldn’t find single mid-sized branch where he could give us examples of default loans. It was decided that we would be taken to a big branch. That Habib Bank branch in Karachi said one of the loans had gone into default, but things had been discussed and it would be adjusted. So if we wanted to see it, we would have to go immediately. That was the first time I learn about default loans.”",
            "He returned to Dhaka after the training. There were hardly any default loans in Dhaka either. “It seemed as if we were taught simply because it was in the text book. But once the country became independent, that is when I really got to understand what default was all about,” he said.",
            "Initially, he recalled, there weren’t many default loans, but gradually these began to pile up. It was the rule that if a loan turned bad, Bangladesh Bank would default it. Then it was said that if a loan was not recovered in a particular span of time, it would go into default. And now almost all loans are defaulted. It is a matter of luck if a few good loans are found. “This was a new experience for me.”",
            "Coming to his post-independence experience, Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled said, “I used to work in Habib Bank before. After the country became independent, I had the opportunity to work in quite a few banks. In Habib Bank, one would have to go through a lot of processes to get a loan. The officer would have to sign a document saying he was satisfied with everything and then granted the loan. If for any reason the loan turned bad, that officer would be under pressure to recover the loan. In fact, in some cases a portion of the loan would be recovered from that officer. There was a personal liability.”",
            "The former banker observed, that sense of liability had diminished after the independence of Bangladesh. It was as if no one was bothered who approved the loan, who recommended it or who disbursed it. No one is held liable.",
            "“It all began in the eighties, during the rule of General Ershad,” said banker Khaled. “The financial sector reform programme was taken up under the World Bank. The World Bank formed a team of officials from Europe and America. They were given responsibility of every bank. They worked for five years and vastly improved the banks of the country. The moment they left, the loan default simply went back to where it was. That shows we do not want to go by any rules or regulations, not even the highest authorities. That is the basic problem.”",
            "When asked about how successful he was in curtailing default loans and other irregularities during his banking career, the former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank said that he had been quite successful in cutting down on loan default when he was with Sonali Bank and Agrani Bank. “If a managing director wants, he can do it, unless there is some intervention. During my time, there wasn’t so much intervention.”",
            "He went on to say, “In 1996 Awami League was in power. The government wouldn’t directly interfere with the banking sector as it does now. There were requests and lobbying then too, but not from so high up as now. It was from the mid-level and we could resist. If anyone tried to force our hand, we would also take action.”",
            "“For example,” continued Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled, “I joined the central bank when Lutfur Rahman Sarkar was governor. A businessman, close to the centre of power, once insulted him and even grabbed him by the collar. Lutfur Rahman Sarkar rushed into my room, and the businessman by then had left. He informed the finance minister Shah AMS Kibria and a few others about the matter.",
            "The man eventually had to come to Lutfur Rahman Sarkar and apologise. It was because we were active that he had to apologise. SAMS Kibria was a very straight speaking man. But that man was even more powerful, no one could stand up against him, let alone the governor. But it all depends on how actively one deals with such matters. Those who are in Bangladesh Bank are simply not capable of complaining to the top level.”",
            "Examples were placed before Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled about a bank board being taken over during his time and, more recently, a bank MD being shot at.",
            "“I was deputy governor then,” he recalled, “I heard about shooting at a bank’s board of directors. The police were called and the incident was proven to be true. The governor at the time, Farashuddin, simply dissolved the board without consulting anyone. We did so in a matter of half an hour, following all legal procedures.\"",
            "Minister Kibria called and said, ‘You could have called me before dissolving the board.’ I replied, ‘Then we wouldn’t have been able to dissolve it. You are in politics.’ He then asked, ‘Will you suspend you decision?’ I asked him to speak to the governor. The governor told him the decision would not be suspended otherwise Bangladesh Bank would be non-existent. Bangladesh Bank can’t simply watch out while the board of a bank is embroiled in such clashes.”",
            "“You see,” the retired banker pointed out, “We did so many things and have survived. No one lost their job, no one said anything, though it was obvious that certain people were displeased.”",
            "He said that many such incidents took place, even more serious. But the central bank never dared to dissolve the entire board of a bank. “It is still possible to do what we did,” he asserts, “I believe no political government will obstruct any decision of the governor.”",
            "At a certain event, Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled had remarked in the presence of the finance minister that the central bank was in the grips of a mafia. Why had he made such a comment?",
            "“I made this comment to catch Mr Kibria’s attention, actually,” came the reply. “I was the MD of Sonali Bank at the time. He was not happy with my remark and said that I could have made the comment to him in private, rather than in public. Later when he met me again, he asked whether I was annoyed. I said I was wondering whether he was annoyed. He said, ‘I am a minister, naturally I was a bit upset. But what you said is very true.’”",
            "Asked why he made such a comment publicly, Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled said he had been the Sonali Bank MD at the time and the CBA there was really rough. Former secretary Asaf-Ud-Dowla was the chairman. Atiur Rahman and Khushi Kabir were directors. The CBA would often come to the board and make all sorts of demands and create disturbance. That was why I had spoken out. The finance minister took it into cognizance. The CBA mafia would take money to arrange for transfers and promotions. The mafia nowadays isn’t involved in such small tasks. The mafia now take loans of billions of taka, with no intention of returning. A portion of that money is shared among certain others. Such mafia are increasing by the day.",
            "Coming to the present, the example of BASIC Bank and a few private banks is raised. Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled said that after the government appointed a political person as BASIC Bank chairman, the bank’s default loans shot up from 1.5 per cent to 80 per cent. It was just because of the chairman and the MD that the bank faced such a predicament.",
            "The government should have held someone liable. After all, a branch manager of the bank couldn’t be responsible for the defaults scaling up to 80 per cent. A bank cannot fall into such dire straits unless the chairman and the MD are at fault. But the chairman is wandering around free.",
            "He says, “The Anti-Corruption Commission reportedly called him twice for a cup of tea and that’s it. So whoever is protecting him is more powerful than the corruption watchdog. No action has been taken against him till now.”",
            "He then turns to Farmers’ Bank. This private sector bank was given to Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir who was also a minister. The bank sunk so low that it couldn’t pay back the depositors their money. It was going bankrupt but the government bailed it out. It made Sonali Bank, Agrani Bank, Janata Bank and Rupali Bank pour in capital. That is fine, but won’t those who took the bank to the brink of bankruptcy be punished, he asked.",
            "He said, “No one questioned the chairman. As I said, there is no accountability. Mahbubul Huq Chisti was caught as he was the vice chairman of the bank, but was he responsible alone? Surely many others were involved.”",
            "So where is the problem?",
            "The former deputy government of the central bank replies that the problem is the absence of accountability. “The basic tenet of good governance is accountability, liability. Unless this is established, there can be no good governance.”",
            "He gives an instance of five members of a family being on the board of a particular private bank, though the law allowed only two members of a family to be on the board of a bank at the same time. Atiur Rahman was the central bank governor at the time and a letter was issued to the bank. The bank didn’t even bother to reply to the central bank’s queries. Instead they complained at a high level and the government amended the law to accommodate four directors from the same family. Those five members of the same family are still on the bank board. Bangladesh Bank doesn’t even look in that direction.",
            "“Actually all political leaders must behave rationally,” he said, “Nowhere else in the world are laws amended to allow violation of the law.”",
            "After 2009, political leaders, activists, even leaders who had lost in the election, were appointed as chairmen or as directors to various banks. Then the banking sector saw one scam after the other. Evaluating this situation, Khondkar Ibrahim Khaled said, these changes have been bought about basically to politicise the banking sector.",
            "“But banks are not a place for politics. Ten per cent of a bank’s funds belongs to the owner or the government. The rest is all public deposits. Bangladesh Bank is responsible for protecting the people’s money. That is why there is so much pressure on the central bank, so that it looks after the interests of the looters rather than public interest. That is the ugly truth,” said Ibrahim Khaled.",
            "“There is no one to uphold the interests of the depositors,” he continued,",
            "“If there was anyone, the BASIC Bank chairman would be punished. So in exchange of what is he being protected? He is no one’s relative, so has he given a share of the BASIC Bank’s loot to anyone? Or else why is he being shielded? The nation must be given a reply to these questions.”",
            "He said that this has given rise to the assumption that a share of the money being looted from the state-owned and private banks must be going to certain quarters within the government and that is why they are being protected. This quarter within the government is not protecting them for nothing, he concluded.",
            "Does that mean the banking sector is an area to mete out political favours?",
            "Money is more powerful than position, the former banker replied. Money is the driving force of politics. Good politicians would never behave in this manner. But good politics has not been established in the country, not in any of the parties. And it’s all about the money from the banks.",
            "The law was amended to keep the Bangladesh Bank governor in office. How does Ibrahim Khaled view that?",
            "Ibrahim Khaled said there has been precedence of this during the rule of the BNP government. The chief justice had one time been with BNP and the BNP government extended the retirement age of judges to 67 years to retain him in office. Now after a long time, Awami League is doing the same. There is no problem in extending the age limit for a post, but it is not correct to change the law for this purpose. That will make the governor entirely obliged to the government. He will have to compromise.",
            "Previously, when reports of irregularities appeared in the media, action was taken. Now the focus is more how the news was leaked to the media. What is Ibrahim Khaled’s experience in this regard?",
            "He agrees that in the past if any such report appeared in the media, an inquiry was launched immediately. Now measures are taken so these irregularities are not exposed. That means those who are committing the misdemeanours are extremely powerful. It will be difficult to break out of this circle and restore a healthy environment in the banking sector. The government must have the intention from a top level to fix the sector, but there are no signs visible.",
            "Commenting about his recent appointment as chairman to Intentional Leasing which had been looted by Prasanta Kumar Haldar, Khondkar Khaled Ibrahim said the Supreme Court judge had thought he would be able to do the difficult task. “In fact, I did carry out a lot of work, but PK Haldar and his associates had already looted money from the company and siphoned off some abroad. So unless PK Haldar is brought back to the country, nothing can be done. This will need a huge amount of effort and hard work which is not possible for me at my age. That is why I stepped down. The new chairman Nazrul Islam is a very competent man. He will be able to complete my unfinished work.”",
            "Khondkar Khaled Ibrahim agreed that PK Haldar, no matter how crafty, couldn’t have pulled off the scam without being aided and abetted by certain powerful quarters. He said these quarters must be identified and exposed. “I hope the Anti-Corruption Commission does this, but given the prevailing circumstances, that does not seem likely.”",
            "He elaborates, “The scenario I have witnessed is terrible. Bangladesh Bank does not want to admit it but there are at least five financial institutions that are in extremely bad condition. All their money has been looted. Bangladesh Bank had failed to supervise these institutions. It has taken no action.”",
            "He said that many were of the view that persons within the central bank were in collusion with PK Haldar. “It is obvious that such a big scam can’t be carried out without support from within the central bank,” he contended.",
            "So what should the role of the central bank be at present?",
            "He is blunt, “The officers of the central bank are performing in the manner that they have been groomed. With just a 2 per cent deposit, default loans are being regularised. The circular in this regard was not prepared by the central bank, it just signed it. It was written by someone who doesn’t even know good Bangla. It was written in English and the central bank translated it. It was sent to the central bank via the ministry. If the central bank cannot prevent this, then there is no way to improve the banking sector.”",
            "He said there is no one of strong personality in the central bank. There were many officers of strong personality before, but the government will not appoint such persons. The government must decide not to intervene politically into institutions like the central bank, the Anti-Corruption Commission, the public service commission and so on. The government claims that it does not intervene, but it is obvious that it does.",
            "So how should the banking sector operate?",
            "“The first precondition for the banking sector to run properly is political commitment from the highest level. Authority can be delegated, but responsibility cannot,” he said, adding, “If competent and correct governors, deputy governors and MDs are appointed, a lot of good can be done. Now five owners of the banking sector collect funds and donate it to the government’s relief fund. It is hardly significant funds for the government, but it has created a bad impression among the people. Meanwhile, the bank owners imagine they have bought the government and run their banks accordingly.”",
            "He admits that not all bank owners are bad and says 90 per cent of them are good. He said the government would be advised well if they consulted the good directors rather than the bad ones. And rather than collecting money for government funds, the bank should take measures to protect the interests of the depositors. He concludes, “The banking sector can be fixed only if the government wants, otherwise not.”",

            "This is for the first time in Bangladesh's history that any member of parliament has been jailed overseas on criminal charges",
            "Bangladesh's member of parliament (Lakshmipur-2) Md Shahid Islam alias Papul, arrested in a sensational human trafficking and money laundering case, has been sentenced to four years imprisonment in Kuwait.",
            "On Thursday, Kuwaiti criminal court counselor Abdullah Al-Othman delivered the verdict, sentencing the MP for bribery. He was also fined 1.9 million Kuwait dinars (Tk 531 million).",
            "The court's verdict on the charges of human trafficking and money laundering against him, however, could not be ascertained.",
            "Sources in Kuwait told Prothom Alo that though Shahid Islam faces charges of human trafficking and money laundering, on Thursday he was sentenced on charges of giving bribes to various quarters in Kuwait.",
            "When the Bangladesh embassy in Kuwait was contacted on Friday morning, it was learnt that the oil-rich country has still not informed Bangladesh of the matter officially.",
            "This is for the first time in Bangladesh's history that any member of parliament has been jailed overseas on criminal charges.",
            "Earlier on 6 June last year, Shahid Islam was arrested from his residence in Kuwait. This Bangladesh lawmaker was sentenced seven and a half months after being detained in Kuwait and three and a half months after the trial began.",
            "The verdict passed on Thursday coincided with the publication of Transparency International's 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index. Bangladesh ranked 12 among the most corrupt countries, falling by two slots.",
            "The Kuwaiti court also sentenced to four years' imprisonment Sheikh Mazen Al Jarrah, the expelled undersecretary of the interior ministry and two other officials who aided and abetted in the deals, Hassan Al Khader and Nawaf Al-Mutairi. Like Shahid, the three convicted Kuwait nationals were fined 1.9 million dinars each. However, the court acquitted two Kuwaiti MPs, Saadoun Hammad Al-Otaibi and Salah Khurshid, of charges in the same case.",
            "Shahid is the managing director and CEO of Marafie Kuwaitia Group, a labour and security contracting company registered in Kuwait. In the charges brought against him, it was said that he had taken large payments from workers of Bangladesh, promising them employment in Kuwait. However, it was alleged, they were not given the jobs or wages he had promised. He had initially denied these allegations outright. Later, however, after being interrogated by Kuwaiti intelligence and being faced with evidence and his Kuwaiti associates, he admitted to these charges.",
            "He admitted that he had paid millions of dollars to politicians and government officials in Kuwait to get work contracts and to appoint workers from Bangladesh.",
            "When asked about Bangladeshi MP Shahid's being sentenced in Kuwait, Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) speaker Shireen Sharmin Chaudhury on Thursday told Prothom Alo, \"Kuwait is yet to officially inform us about the arrest or sentencing of the Lakshmipur-2 independent MP Shahid Islam. I've learnt about his from the media. Once we receive the information officially, legal action will be taken in keeping with the parliamentary rules of procedure and the constitution.\"",
            "According to Rule 172 of the parliamentary rules of procedure, \"When a member is arrested on criminal charge or for a criminal offence or is sentenced to imprisonment by a court, or is detained under an executive order, the committing judge, magistrate, or executive authority, as the case may be, shall immediately intimate such fact to the Speaker indicating the reasons for the arrest, detention or imprisonment of the member.\"",
            "Then according to Rule 176, the Speaker will read this out in parliament in in session or it will be circulated for the information of the members.",
            "In the meantime, a Dhaka court has ordered that 670 bank accounts of six persons, including MP Shahid, be frozen in two cases for amassing wealth outside of known means of income and money laundering. Of these, 617 bank accounts are in the name of the MP and his wife, who is also a MP from reserved seat.",
            "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) filed human trafficking and money laundering charges against six persons including Shahid on 22 December last year. The accused include Shahid's daughter, brother and sister-in-law.",
            "Earlier on 11 November, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) had filed a case against Shahid and his wife on human trafficking charges.",
            "Winning in Lakshmipur-2 seat in the 2018 election, Shahid Islam amassed wealth overnight. The local people said that in 1989 Shahid had gone to Kuwait as a labour supervisor for a cleaning company. He was more or less penniless at the time. He had to return in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait but returned when things went back to normal. He then began sending people from various areas of Lakshmipur and Cumilla to Kuwait, with assurances of jobs.",
            "Shahid made huge amounts of money by trafficking people of Kuwait and also through his visa business. He even used his money to make wife Selina Islam an MP from the reserved seats for women.",
            "It was an open secret that in the 2018 general election, Shahid used his money to push the Awami-League-led Mahajote ('grand alliance') candidate, Jatiya Party's Mohammad Noman, out of the fray in Lakshmipur. He suddenly appeared on the scene as candidate and his winning the election came as a surprise. Even as an independent candidate, he had been confident of winning. His wife became an independent candidate in the women's quota. It is said that he spent over Tk 500 million (Tk 50 crore) to clinch the parliamentary seats for himself and his wife.",
            "President of Lakshmipur unit of Shushaner Jonno Nagorik (Shujan) Kamal Hossain said that when the country lacks good governance, unscrupulous businessmen and dishonest persons use their wealth to become people's representatives. It is extremely shameful for the country that a lawmaker has been sentenced to imprisonment abroad.",
            "In a similar reaction, Raipur upazila Awami League president, Mamunur Rashid, told Prothom Alo, \"I have heard about the sentence. This is very unfortunate for the people of our Lakshmipur-2 (Raipur) constituency. Before he became an MP, we had no idea that he was involved in all these misdeeds in Kuwait.\"",
            "According to Bangladesh's constitution, an MP will lose his seat in parliament if takes the citizenship of a foreign country or pledges his loyalty to a foreign state, if proven guilty of criminal offence due to moral turpitude and is sentenced to not less than two years imprisonment.",
            "Supreme Court lawyer Shahdeen Malik on Thursday night told Prothom Alo, the election commission decides on whether a person qualifies to be an MP or loses that qualification. And according to the constitution, if anyone is sentenced to two years' imprisonment, there is provision to cancel his seat in parliament. The Kuwait court has awarded Shahid Islam a four-year jail sentence. So this constitutional provision can apply to him.",

Now, Hawa Bhaban’s Manik (Ataur Rahman Bhuiyan alias Manik) and he are the senior vice presidents of the district Awami League committee. But a dedicated person like Sahab Uddin, chairman of Companiganj upazila, has been made an advisor. This is our district committee! Some leaders say they know nothing.”",

Arms were sent here to make the election disputable. But I will hold a fair and free election. Bangbabandhu freed the country to establish the rights to food and franchise of the people. Rights to food have been established under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina, not the rights to vote. I will set an example from this municipality."

Over the past decade, international law has been drawn up to reveal such information. However, the Bangladesh government has displayed no interest in this regard.

But Switzerland no longer has that law. Even so, due to political and economic reasons, our government shows no inclination to collect information on capital flight. The reason is because it is mostly persons who are close to the government that are involved in this money laundering. The relevant agencies too, do not take any initiative in this regard without a go-ahead from the government.”",

Executive director of the anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Iftekharuzzaman, told Bangladesh, “The lion’s share of this wealth is illegally transferred money. Switzerland is a signatory of the UN anti-corruption convention and so they release information of the deposits of persons from all over the world. Every year news is released about Bangladeshi nationals’ deposits in the Swiss banks, but the Bangladesh government never wants to know whose money this is and how it got there. The agencies and institutions involved in anti-corruption and anti-money laundering activities also take no initiative in this regard. That is why, other than the Swiss bank accounts, capital flight to offshore destinations and island states is also on the rise.\""

        "date": "11 Jun 2020",
        "content": [
            "Sikder Group has issued a rejoinder to the report, ‘Sikder family amasses wealth in Las Vegas, other big cities of the world’, published in Prothom Alo on 9 June.",
            "In the rejoinder signed by the group’s vice president Mahfuzur Rahman, it was said, “The report contains certain misleading and irresponsible remarks that may create questions in the public mind concerning the group’s reputation.”",
            "In the beginning of the rejoinder, it was said, “Prothom Alo and all concerned should be aware that the Sikder family, now established as the Sikder Group, left the country after the assassination of Bangabandhu in 1975 and went to India. They later left Bangladesh and went on to the US in 1980 for business purposes. In 1981 they formed a corporate company in the US and for long the Sikder Group had a real estate business there. The earnings and profits from that business were subsequently invested overseas where their wealth was created. No funds were siphoned out of the country to amass wealth abroad.”",
            "The rejoinder denied the report’s claims of ownership in the Swiss TV channel CNNMoney. It said CNNMoney was a web-based news portal in which the Sikder Group has shares.",
            "“The indications in report that National Bank may have been used to launder money are fabricated,” the rejoinder said, adding, “Even before National Bank was founded, the Sikder Group had business in the US. Rather than transferring money abroad, the group has often brought in foreign exchange. The St Kitts and Nevis resort mentioned in the report is basically a partnership-based business set up with support from the government of that country.”",
            "According to the rejoinder, “The mention in the report of attempts to shoot the Exim Bank MD is irrelevant and unwarranted. The matter is under investigation and it is unlawful to make such judgemental statements at this stage.”",
            "The rejoinder said that it was completely untrue that Ron Haque Sikder and Dipu Haque Sikder left the country in guise of patients. It said, “Ron Haque Sikder was unwell and after taking all required permission, left by air ambulance to go to Thailand for treatment to save his life. He is still under treatment in hospital there. Such unverified news surmounts to spreading false information about an individual.”",
            "“In questioning the parliamentary membership of Parveen Haque Sikder, daughter of the group’s chairman Zainul Haque Sikder, the authority of the prime minister has been questioned,” the rejoinder went on to say.",
            "The rejoinder expressed regret at banker Ibrahim Khaled’s questioning how the Sikder Group’s funds were transferred overseas. It said, “He later called up his uncle Sulaiman Khan Majlis and apologised for his misleading remarks.”",
            "“Salauddin sahib [referring to Salehuddin Ahmed] made similar remarks which are unfounded. As said before, the group’s investments were from the business they began overseas in 1981,” the rejoinder stated, concluding, “we believe in future a responsible newspaper like Prothom Alo will carry out due investigations before presenting such reports.”",
            "Prothom Alo gathered all information regarding investments made overseas from the official company registration documents in those respective countries. The Sikder Group has not denied the information in that regard. The group has claimed that they have been doing business in the US since 1981 from which they have invested in other countries and created their wealth. However, while the group website mentions having business overseas, it has no information on the investments or wealth. National Bank’s website has a biography of Sikder Group’s chairman Zainul Haque Sikder. This book, Zainul Haque Sikder: Betrikromo Bektityo, (Zainul Haque Sikder: A Unique Personality), was written by Badiuzzaman Chowdhury, president of the Greater Faridpur History Heritage Council. It speaks of all sorts of miraculous events behind the success of Sikder family’s business. It relates how their truck business was failing and the truck tyres were repeatedly getting damaged, and then by a miracle, the trucks ran perfectly on those damaged tyres and from then they began making money.",
            "Similarly, miracles were behind the success of their contracting business. It writes how he went to America, saw a house as he was walking along and bought it for 200,000 dollars, but it does not explain where a man, newly arrived in America, got so much money or whether he took it with him there. Bangladesh Bank does not have information on the matter either.",
            "Investment funds cannot be taken overseas without permission of Bangladesh Bank. There is no scope of taxpayers showing this in their tax files either.",
            "NBR officials, both past and incumbent, told Prothom Alo that there was no legal provision for such overseas investment, and so they could not include this in the tax forms.",
            "The NBR officials said that many taxpayers smuggled out their illegally earned wealth and so naturally kept this a secret. That is why the Prothom Alo report raised questions in this regard.",
            "The mention in the report of the attack on the Exim Bank MD in presence of the National Bank MD is relevant, as information regarding their overseas investment surfaced when probes were made into why the two brothers left the country in the guise of patients after a case was filed regarding the incident.",
            "Regarding the rejoinders’ statement, former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, Khondokar Ibrahim Khaled told Prothom Alo. “I have no uncle by the name of Sulaiman Khan Majlis. He was the MD of a bank. I spoke to him, but the question of my apologising does not arise. Everything I had said is absolutely true and I stand by my statement. I think the Sikder Group is trying to blackmail me.”",
            "Former governor of Bangladesh Bank, Salehuddin Ahmed, told Prothom Alo, “I spoke with knowledge of what I was saying. It is the state’s failure that wealth from Bangladesh is being siphoned overseas. This is supported by the statement of Bangladesh Bank. These investments were made without their approval.”"

The highest amount, $11.51billion flew from the country in 2015 while $5.28 billion, $8.9 billion, $7.09 billion, $8 billion, $7.12 billion and $8.82 billion were siphoned off the country in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively.",

For example, Ecuador’s data show that the country had exported bananas worth $20 million to the US while the US shows it actually imported the item $15 million that year. The misinvoicing consists of a $5 million gap.",
            "A total of $3.29 billion was laundered from Bangladesh to the developed countries per year. In 2015, the amount stood at $4.58 billion while in 2008 it stood at $2.55 billion. ",

This was decreased to Tk 308.95 billion (Tk 30,895 crore) in the revised budget. Till 29 May this year, so far Tk 186.39 billion (Tk 18,639 crore) has been borrowed from the banks.",
            "Another source of finance to meet the budget deficit is savings certificates. With high interest rates, savings certificate sales are breaking records. The sales target for saving certificate in the current fiscal had been for Tk 261.97 billion (Tk 26,197 crore) but by March this year, already savings certificates worth Tk 397.33 billion (Tk 39,733 crore) had been sold. The target in the revised budget was Tk 450 billion (Tk 45,000 crore) and this too is likely to be exceeded.",
            "Excessive sale of savings certificate creates two kinds of problems. As interest rates on the certificates are high, depositors prefer to invest in this tool rather than deposit their savings in banks. Thus bank deposits lessen, as at present. Most banks are now desperately seeking deposits. Interest on deposits is now exceeding 10 per cent, but the government is saying this interest has to be kept within 6 per cent and interest on loans at 9 per cent.",
            "Another downside of high savings certificate sales in that expenditure on interest increases. As a result of such costly loans year after year, the budget allocation now for payment of interest is 18.3 per cent of expenditure.",
            "According to the finance ministry, the government collected Tk 524.17 billion (Tk 52,417 crore) in FY2016-17 for savings certificate sales and Tk 465.300 billion (Tk 46,530 crore) in FY2017-18.",
            "Speaking to Prothom Alo in this regard, chief economist of the World Bank Dhaka office Zahid Hossain said, when there was money in the banks three years ago, the government turned to selling savings certificates to generate funds. But now at the wrong time they are aiming to take loans from the banking sector. There is no cash in the banks and borrowing from this sector will simply deepen the liquidity crisis. And taking loans from the central bank will push up inflation. This would not have been a problem had there been discipline in the banking sector.",
            "Zahid Hossain went on to say, the budget does not have any specific mention of the prevailing crisis in the banking sector. The loan defaulters must be nabbed in order to fix the sector, the confidence of the depositors must be restored. Instead of controlling the dollar rate, the market should be allowed to control it. This will ease the liquidity crisis to an extent. The question is, when economic growth is so good and when agricultural production is so high, why are deposits dropping?",
            "Banks run after money",
            "Faced with the liquidity crisis, many private banks are running on loans from Bangladesh Bank and the state-owned banks. Only a handful of banks, other than the state-owned ones, have sufficient funds for investment. Many are even offering up to 14 per cent interest on deposits in order to resolve their liquidity crisis. This is pushing up interest rates on loans steadily, going up to 16 to 17 per cent.",
            "Executive director of Policy Research Institute, Ahsan H Mansur, told Prothom Alo, the banks have no money. If loans are taken from the banking sector, the liquidity crisis will worsen and inflation may increase. Reserve money growth will probably exceed the target this fiscal. He said, the government should place stress on revenue collection rather than loans from the domestic sector. This will require initiative and extensive reforms in the revenue board."

            "Mustafizur Rahman: We are about to see the budget of a new finance minister after 10 years. I think there will be a continuity. It would be unreasonable to expect any radical change overnight. However, given the state of Bangladesh’s economy, there is a growing need for a fresh formulation of the budget.",
            "The steady achievements that the macro-economy had seen -- the control on the budget deficit and inflation, increase in government investment, positive balance in transactions – are now somewhat at risk. And this will be the last budget of the seventh 5-year plan. This budget should have link with the development and growth trends to be part of the planning for the eighth 5-year plan. ",
            " Prothom Alo: Bangladesh is doing well in many sectors, but all this may be pitched into risk. That is why there is a talk of sustainable development. Should the budget have some safety initiatives in place?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: On average we are doing well, but from the angle of socially inclusive development or sustainable development, this development has to be three dimensional -- of economic growth, social inclusion and environment friendly.",
            "There has been serious discrepancy in distribution and in alleviating inequalities. After 2024 when we emerge from the LDC status, we will have to enter a more competitive market. So the challenge for the budget will be to invigorate the private sector through increased investment and enhanced capacity for supply and competition.\nProthom Alo: What is to be done to decrease the inequity?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: Income, expenditure and redistribution are the three aspects of the budget. There have to be changes in the budget concerning income and expenditure. When it comes to income, our direct taxes are one third of the total taxes. And personal taxes are one third of the direct taxes. In other countries of the world, it is absolutely the opposite. That is, the government collects funds through the budget and invests it.",
            "Again, the laws pertaining to loan defaulters and tax defaulters are not being implemented properly. Corruption too leads to inequity.\nProthom Alo: Is capital flight also contributing to inequity?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: Yes, it is. There is a law against money laundering. The National Board of Revenue has a transfer pricing cell. A global report every year points out that the amount of money being siphoned out of Bangladesh every year, is more than our foreign earnings and investment. NBR and Bangladesh Bank have to work jointly to thwart this capital flight. There is a transfer pricing cell but no investment has been made for it.\nProthom Alo: Which sector should be given priority in the budget? Will the income and expenditure layout remain the same?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: The government has to restructure its expenditure. For example, expenditure in the education sector constitutes less than 2.2 per cent of the GDP. This should be increased to 4 per cent. The health sector is less than 1 per cent. This should be doubled at least. It is said that the budget allocation for the social security sector is 3 per cent of the GDP, but if pension is left out, it is actually 1.7 per cent. There are inequities in our policies too. These must be cleared up.\nProthom Alo: Do you have any new advice for the banking sector?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: The banking sector is very sensitive for the economy. The private investment has almost come to a standstill. There have been certain initiatives in recent times regarding loan defaulters. Instead of punishing loan defaulters and money launderers, they are being rewarded. This will not bode well. From beforehand, there had been steps to allow four members of one family to be on the board of directors in a bank and they could remain on the board for 9 years at a stretch. This is not good.\nProthom Alo: What specific advice do you have?",
            "Mustafizur Rahman: The crux of the problems has to be addressed. Year after year public taxes are being paid to the banks. The public should not pay for the mismanagement and institutional weaknesses of the banks. This is simply a nationalisation of the damage.",
            "CPD had recommended that a commission be formed for the banking sector. The finance minister at the time, AMA Muhith had agreed too. The government in its own interests should allow the central bank to function freely. That is internationally known as ‘enlightened self-interest’.\n• This interview, originally published in Prothom Alo print edition has been rewritten in English by Ayesha Kabir"

Coming in either through formal channels or informal ones, the overall economy is benefitted by the remittance. The the huge deposits from remittance has salvaged the banking sector from falling into a major crisis, afflicted as it is with huge default loans. These remittances also are a crucial alternative to FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). Our failure of draw foreign investment is made up by the remittance flow and it also has caused surprising leap of the GDP.",

The biggest customers of such money are the businessman from Bangladesh who uphold the 'culture' of default loan and who are the owners of black money. Many of the upper middle and upper class families are involved in capital flight. The 'second homes' in Malaysia or Begumpara in Toronto are emerging from such wealth.",
